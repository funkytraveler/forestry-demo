<p>TT Sniper is an Order Ticket Algo (OTA) that allows you to hide your intent to buy or sell at a given price until there is quantity available at that price on the opposite side of the market.</p>

<p>When submitted, TT Sniper looks at the quantity available on the opposite side of the market at the specified order price for the given contract. If there is at least one lot available at this price or better, a child Limit order will be submitted at this price with a quantity equal to the available or remaining quantity to execute, whichever is less.</p>

<p>If the full child order quantity is not immediately filled, TT Sniper will cancel the balance and add the unfilled quantity back to the quantity remaining to be filled. It will repeat this until the total quantity is filled.</p>

<p>You can launch a TT Sniper algo from the following widgets:
	<ul>

				<li><a href="#launch">Algo Dashboard</a>
					<li><a href="#launch">Autotrader</a>
