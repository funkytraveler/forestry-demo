    <p>From the Options Chain, you can create a synthetic options spread as a user-defined strategy in the Strategy Creation widget. These spreads can be published to the market by the exchange and made available from trading in the current trading 
      session.</p>
    <p>The Options Chain provides quick access to the following commonly-used strategies as well as a custom option to define your own strategies.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Strip</b>: Series of same-side orders for a range of consecutive months</li>
      <li><b>Calendar</b>: Two opposite-side orders for different months</li>
      <li><b>Combo</b>: Orders for both call and put options for the same strike price</li>
      <li><b>Combo &Delta;0</b>: Covered combo in which the options are hedged by the underlying instrument with a neutral delta</li>
      <li><b>Fly</b>: Butterfly strategy with two legs equidistant from leg on the opposite side.</li>
      <li><b>Custom</b>: User-defined combination of legs, quantities, and ratios</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you select one of the strategies, the Options Chain automatically ensures that strategies contain the proper relationship, quantities, and ratios for the strategy legs. For example, if you select a Combo strategy and select one end of the range, the Options Chain automatically adds all of the intervening legs.</p>
