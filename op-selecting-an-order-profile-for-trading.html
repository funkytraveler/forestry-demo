<p>As you click on different profiles in Order Profiles, order entry widgets are automatically seeded with the best match rules for each profile. 
</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: Order entry widgets can not be seeded with different profiles while editing a profile or adding a rule. Ensure that you save all changes before selecting a profile.</p>

	 <p>The open order entry widgets are seeded with the variable fields of the best match rule for the selected profile.<!-- Any opened order management widgets (e.g., Positions, Audit Trail, etc.) are filtered with the selected account.--></p>
