  <!-- <p>You can use the RFQ Viewer to conveniently open and populate the legs of the Blocktrader widget to report an OTC (block) trade in response to an RFQ. For example, as a broker, you can contact two or more counterparties upon receiving an RFQ for an options contract (e.g., 6A DEC) and complete a transaction that includes the 6A DEC contract. Using the RFQ Viewer, you can seed a Blocktrader widget with the 6A DEC contract, configure the widget with the price, counterparties, and strategy legs as needed and report the transaction to the exchange.</p> -->



  <p><b>Note</b>: Before opening Blocktrader, ensure that the <b>BT</b> column is shown in the RFQ Viewer. To show this column, right-click in the RFQ Viewer and select <b>Settings</b> | <b>Set RFQ Viewer columns</b> from the context menu.</p>
