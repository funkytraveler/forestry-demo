    <h2 id="launch-fob">Launching a Floating Order Book in MD Trader</h2>
    <p>To launch a Floating Order Book in MD Trader:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Middle-click a working order cell in MD Trader.

            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            In the Floating Order Book, you can change the <strong>WrkQty</strong> (working quantity), <strong>Price</strong>, or <strong>TrgPrc</strong> (trigger price).

<div>
    <h2 id="reduce-multi-qty">Reducing the total quantity of multiple orders at a price level</h2>
    <p>If you have multiple orders working at the same price level, you can quickly reduce the total quantity of the these orders. TT will begin deleting newer orders, so you maintain the best position-in-queue, until the total quantity of the remaining orders matches your desired lower total. </p>

    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/mdt-reduce-qty-intro.png" alt=""/></p>

    <p>For example, suppose you place three working orders at a price level of 10, 20 and 30, respectively, for a total order quantity of 60 at that price level. You then decide you only want to work a total quantity of 30 contracts. TT would delete the 30-lot order (the most recent) to bring the total quantity to 30. Conversely, if you placed the same orders in reverse (30, 20, 10), TT would delete the 10- and 20-lot orders, leaving the single 30-lot order. If necessary, TT will change the quantity of the newest remaining order to acheive the desired total quantity.</p>
    <p>This feature is supported only for the following order types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Limit</li>
        <li>Stop limit</li>
<li>Stop market</li>
        <li>TT Stop</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To reduce the quantities of all orders at a price level:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Right-click on the working order cell on the price-level with multiple working orders.
            <p></p>
            An entry box appears showing the current total working quantity of the orders at that price level.
            <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/mdt-reduce-qty-1.png" alt=""/></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Enter the desired new, lower total quantity, and click <img src="Content/mdt-reduce-qty-checkbox.png" alt="the check">. Note that you can only decrease the quantity; you cannot increase the quantity.
            <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/mdt-reduce-qty-2.png" alt=""/></p>
            Notice the total working quantity updates.
            <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/mdt-reduce-qty-3.png" alt=""/></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            If desired, you can display the Floating Order Book to see the remaining working orders.
            <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/mdt-reduce-qty-4.png" alt=""/></p>
        </li>
    </ol>

            <!-- <p class="">Users
                    often submit multiple orders at the same price level. When this
                    occurs, MD Trader shows the total number of your orders at that
                price level.</p>
                <p class="">You can access and change each separate order
                    by pressing the arrow (&gt;) button located next to the order in the ladder. This opens a side-drawer which
                    shows the different orders. You can then select an individual order
                or ctrl-click and select multiple orders. </p>
                <p class="">Once selected,
                    you can perform a cancel/replace by moving any order to a different
                price level.</p> -->
