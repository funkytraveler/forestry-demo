<p>Using Autospreader, you can create a synthetic spread using an Aggregator instrument as one of the spread legs. For example, you can create a Basis Spread using an aggregated cash instrument as the front leg and a treasury futures instrument as the back leg.
</p>

<!-- <p>Before you begin, ensure that the <a href="agg-creating-an-aggregated-instrument.html">aggregated instrument</a> has been created and launched into the market. The following example shows an aggregated instrument (5 Yr Cash) made up of the Mar17 contracts for BrokerTec 5-year bonds (5_YEAR) and eSpeed 5-year bonds (usg_05y). When launched in Aggregator, the aggregated instrument appears in the Market Explorer and product search results and is available to trade.</p> -->

<p>Before you begin, create and launch the <a href="agg-aggregator-overview.html">aggregated instrument</a> or ensure that the instrument is available in the market. The following example shows the configuration for an aggregated instrument comprising the contracts for BrokerTec 5-year bonds (5_YEAR) and eSpeed 5-year bonds (usg_05y). When launched in Aggregator, the aggregated instrument (e.g., 5 Yr Cash) appears in Market Explorer and product search results and is available to trade.</p>
