<p>The same workspace management capabilities in X_TRADER are also provided on the TT platform. X_TRADER workspaces cannot be reused on TT, but they can be rebuilt in TT using the same workspace functionality and are accessible from any device that can connect to the Internet. On TT, <a href="http://library.tradingtechnologies.com/trade/ttw-creating-and-opening-a-workspace-in-trade.html">Workspaces are created, opened, and managed</a> using the <a href="http://library.tradingtechnologies.com/trade/ttw-home-page.html">TT home page</a>, which is the landing page after you log in to the platform.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Users can <a href="http://library.tradingtechnologies.com/trade/ttw-importing-and-exporting-workspaces.html">import/export workspaces</a> for sharing with other users.</li>

  <li>As an administrator, you can delete, rename, or copy <a href="http://library.tradingtechnologies.com/trade/ttw-managing-templates.html">workspace templates</a> for users in your company.</li>

</ul>



<h2 id="workspaces">Workspaces in X_TRADER vs. TT</h2>

<p>On TT, you have access to your workspaces from any device that can connect to the Internet to log in to the platform. On the X_TRADER platform, you have to manually copy your workspace files from one workstation and paste these files on another X_TRADER workstation in order to access your workspaces from a different machine.</p>

<p>The main difference between creating a workspace in X_TRADER and TT is that:</p<>

<ul>
 <li>In X_TRADER you add <strong>trading windows</strong> to your desktop and save it as a workspace, which is essentially a snapshot of your desktop.</p>

  <li>On TT, you first create a blank workspace, then add <strong>trading widgets</strong> to the workspace, which consists of one or more <strong>workspace windows</strong>. A widget in TT provides the same function as a trading window in X_TRADER.
 
<!-- <p>In TT, the workspace itself comprises one or more "windows".</p> -->

<ul>
