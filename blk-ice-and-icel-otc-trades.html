<p>The Blocktrader widget supports entering the following OTC trades on ICE and ICE_L exchanges on TT:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cross &mdash; Prearranged trades with either a party within
the trading firm itself or with a specified party outside the firm.</li>

 	<li>Block &mdash; High volume trades in any outright or strategy
product. Supported on <strong>ICE_L</strong> only. The following types of Block trades are supported:

<ul> 	
	<li>Exchange For Swap (EFS): allows trades to offset a specific
OTC swap transaction for a similar commodity or a direct product
of that commodity.</li>
 	<li>Exchange Options for Options (EOO): allows a trade of an exchange option
position for a corresponding OTC option position. This replicates
the EFS functionality available for Futures contracts.</li>


<li>Exchange Futures for Physical (EFP): trades between the Futures market and the underlying physical
market.</li>

<li>Asset Allocation: allows the trader to enter one side
(buy or sell) of a wholesale order. Alternatively, one trader can
enter the entire Asset Allocation.</li>

</ul>
</li>


</li>
 	
 	 	<li>Basis Trades: strategies for long-term bond markets that include
a Futures leg and an underlying (cash) leg. Supported on <strong>ICE_L</strong> only.</li>





</ul>

<h2 class="LabelHead">Before You Begin</h2>
<p class="">Before submitting an OTC trade, complete the following:</p>

<ul>
 	<li>Ensure that wholesale
trading is enabled for your user in Setup on TT.</li>
 	<li>Contact ICE to enable the wholesale trading functionality.</li>
