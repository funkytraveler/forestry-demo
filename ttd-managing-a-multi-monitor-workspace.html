 <p>Using the workspace windows functionality, you can add windows and switch between multiple monitors in a single workspace. After adding a window, you can also rename it, delete it, or set it as your default window.</p>

<!-- <p>Multiple windows in TT Desktop can be moved individually within your workspace. If you trade using a multi-monitor desktop, you can create windows and drag them to each monitor.</p> -->

  <p>When you reopen a saved multi-monitor workspace, the windows will automatically return to the same location or monitors they were at when the workspace was previously saved and closed.</p>

<p>After you create a multi-monitor workspace in TT Desktop, you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add, edit, or delete windows</li>
  <li>Send widgets from one window to another window.</li>
  <li>Move one or more windows to different monitors.</li>
</ul>
