<h2 id="upload">About the order profile upload file</h2> 

<p>When <a href="op-uploading-order-profiles-to-tt.html">uploading order profiles into TT</a>, the <strong>.csv</strong> file must adhere to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Files must be saved as plain text format.</li>
  <li>The filename must use a <strong>.csv</strong> file extension.</li>
  <li>Data fields must be comma delimited.</li>
  <li>Spaces after commas (for readability) are allowed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sample .csv file</h3>
<pre>
FCM_Customer,FCM_IsActive,FCM_Product,FCM_Exchange,FCM_Group,FCM_ProductType,FCM_Account,FCM_ExchAccount,FCM_OrdQty,FCM_MaxQty,FCM_TIF,Clearing Acct,Staged Orders

Customer3,TRUE,ES,CME,*,FUT,SonnAB,456,1,100,GTC,JS-3,
</pre>

<h3>File structure</h3>
<p>The <strong>.csv</strong> file can contain a maximum of 1000 profile rows, as follows:</p>
<ul>
  
  <li>
    Row 1 contains the header column fields as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The row must contain columns for all fields used by any of the profiles.
      </li>
      <li>
        The header column fields should match the header names in Order Profiles, including capitalization.
      </li>
      <li>
        The field columns can be arranged in any order, but the data within a column must match the value expected by the column header.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Rows 2-<i>n</i> (up to 1003) contain the values for a single profile per row.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="columns">Order profile columns</h2> 


<p>To show the optional MiFID II columns in Order Profiles, right-click the rules panel of the widget and select the <b>Edit Columns...</b> option.</p>

<p>To filter column rows, click the right hand portion of a column header. Note: the <b>Profile</b> column cannot be filtered because the rule rows are already filtered based on the profile(s) selected in the Profiles panel.
</p>

            <p>When adding a rule or profile, you can set values in the following columns:</p>

            <table class="table table-striped table-bordered" border=1>
