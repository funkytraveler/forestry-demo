<h2>Estimating options risk</h2>
<p>Using the Options Risk widget, you can apply adjustments to the price of the underlying futures contract and global volatility  for options risk to estimate their impact on your open position.</p>

<p>To estimate options risk:</p>

<ol>

		</li>
		<li><p>To estimate your position based on a price move in the underlying futures contract, enter a value in the <b>Underlying
		</b> field.</p>

		<p>Enter a percentage or absolute value based on the <b>Display underlying adjustments as</b> setting in the Options Risk settings. For example, an <b>Underlying</b> value of "5" and unit of measure of "Percentage" represents a 5% increase in the price of the underlying future. Negative values can also be entered.</p>

		<p>The Underlying field highlights yellow when a change is made to this text field.</p>

    </li>
    <li>To estimate your position based on an increase or decrease in global volatility, enter a value in the <b>Vol
		</b> field.

		<p>Enter an absolute value or percentage based on the <b>Display volatility adjustments as</b> setting in the Options Risk settings. For example, a <b>Vol</b> of "10" and unit of measure of "Absolute" represents a 10% increase in global volatility (the absolute value is actually a percentage when estimating changes in volatility). Negative values can also be entered.</p>

	

		<p>The Vol field highlights yellow when a change is made to this text field.</p>

		<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/trade-or-vol-shock1a-combined.png"> </img> </p> 

		<p>If necessary, you can click <b>Reset</b> to move the adjustments back to zero and enter different values as needed.</p>
       
    </li>

    <li><p>To calculate and display the estimated change in your open position based on one or both of the adjustments, click <img src="Content/icon-refresh-highlighted.png"> </img>.</p>
