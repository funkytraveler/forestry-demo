        <h2 id="network">Network requirements</h2>
        <p>Client workstations must support https traffic (via Transport Layer Security) over port <b>443</b> to/from the TT Platform. Therefore, the firm's administrator must allow traffic to the TT Platform's domain as opposed to a specific range of IP addresses. This can be accomplished by either updating firewall restrictions or using an https web proxy.</p>
        <p>You can verify connectivity by pointing a web browser on the client workstation to the following location:</p>
        <p><a href="https://trade.tt" target="_blank">https://trade.tt</a></p>
        <!--
        <p>You must also configure the workstation to access the following domain:</p>
        <p><a href="https://debesys.net" target="_blank">https://debesys.net</a></p>
    -->

    <div>
        <h2 id="email">Email requirements</h2>
        <p>Trading Technologies uses email to send a number of communications including users' initial invitations and notices for general system maintenance. To ensure receipt of invitations, notices, and advisories, users must ensure they can receive emails from <b>noreply@tradingtechnologies.com</b>.</p>
        <p>Users should add <b>noreply@tradingtechnologies.com</b> as a contact in their mail client. In addition, company administrators should configure <b>noreply@tradingtechnologies.com</b> as a valid address for their company email.</p>
