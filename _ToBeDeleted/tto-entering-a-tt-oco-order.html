    <h2>Entering a TT OCO order in MD Trader&reg;</h2>
    <p>In MD Trader, you have to click at two different price levels in the price ladder on the same side of the market to enter the OCO. The first click in the Bids or Asks column highlights the cell at a price level. As you move the cursor to a different price level, the cursor will indicate whether you are entering a Limit order or Stop (Stop Limit or Stop Market) order at a valid price.</p>
    <p>The following example shows how the cursor changes when entering a valid Limit order based on the price and side of the first order:</p>

    <p>The next example shows how the cursor changes when entering a valid Stop order based on the price and side of the first order:</p>
    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/tt-oco-stop-order.png"></p>
    <p>In MD Trader, the cursor also indicates if the second order of a TT OCO order is not allowed. When you hover at the same price as the first click, the cursor displays as "not allowed".</p>
    <p>For a Buy-side OCO order, if you hover <i>below</i> the first click, the OCO order views the first order as a Stop order and validates the price of the Stop against the current last traded price (LTP). If you hover
    <i>above</i> the first click, the OCO order assumes the second order will be a Stop and validates the price of the second order against LTP.</p>
    <p>For a Sell-side OCO order, if you hover <i>above</i> the first click, the OCO order views the first order as a Stop order and validates the Stop order price against the current last traded price (LTP). If you hover <i>below</i> the first click, the OCO order assumes the second order will be a Stop and validates the price of the second order against LTP.</p>
    <p>The following example shows the cursor hovering at an invalid price level:</p>
