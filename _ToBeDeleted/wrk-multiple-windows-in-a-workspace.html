Multiple windows section

<div id="multiple-windows">

  <p>Each workspace has a default window, named <b>Main</b>, on which you can place widgets you want to use to suit your trading needs. You can also add more windows to a workspace to give you more working area or to use separate windows for distinct purposes.</p>

  <p> Each window fills the single workspace, but you can easily switch between the windows. You can use multiple windows within a workspace to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create separate windows for different markets</li>
    <li>Add individual windows for trading related products (treasuries, energies, grains, etc.)</li>
    <li>Dedicate windows to trading for specific accounts</li>
   
    <li>Increase the effective area of a workspace so you are not constrained to the size of your physical display.</li>
  </ul>

<!-- Add wording for sending widgets to other windows (DOC-1503) --> 
<p>You can also also send widgets from one window to another.</p>
