  <p>A workspace is an arrangement or configuration of widgets tailored to your trading preferences. It contains a collection of widgets you use to view market data, enter and manage orders, and track fills and positions. You can create a single workspace for all of your trading, or you can create multiple workspaces with widgets suited to specific trading needs.</p>

  <p>After adding a widget to the workspace, you can click the widget's title bar and drag it to another location on the workspace. When you drag a widget close to another widget, it automatically snaps to the edge of the stationary widget to help you align the widgets. When widgets are snapped together, you can move them as a group by using Ctrl + Left-Click on one of the title bars and dragging the entire snapped group to a new location.</p>
  <P>Each widget also contains a set of icons in the top-right corner that allow you to minimize, maximize or close the widget. Arrange the widgets so the workspace looks like you want it to look. When you are done opening and arranging widgets, save the workspace by clicking the Save icon in the workspace tool bar.</p>
