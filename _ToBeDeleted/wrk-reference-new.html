<div>
    <h3 id="accounts">Accounts</h3>
    <p>This tab includes the following sections:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#routable">Routable Accounts</a></li>
        <li><a href="#account-settings">Account Settings</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/wrk-global-settings-accounts.png" alt="Global account settings"></p>
    <p>Use the <b>Accounts</b> tab in the <b>Preferences</b> window to create and modify your default account for order routing.</p>
    <p>The Account Defaults functionality provides mapping between a selected contract
    and a broker/account pair. Default order information can also be predefined and matched to an account for a selected contract.</p>
    
    <p>The <b>Accounts</b> window consists of two grids: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Routable Accounts -- Provides a way for users to see what tradeable accounts are available to them, along with which exchanges they can use those accounts in.</li>
        <li>Account Settings -- Provides a means to define custom rules that seed broker/accounts into order entry windows upon selecting a contract from the Market Grid or MD TraderÂ® widget.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    
    <div>
        <h4 id="routable">Routable Accounts</h4>
        
        <p>To view routable accounts, select one of the two viewing options available:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Account</b> -- Shows a list of accounts in the first column, and a list of exchange connections that each account is assigned to in the third column. User-defined account aliases are shown in the second column when viewing by account.</li>
                <li><b>Exchange</b> -- Shows a list of exchange connections assigned to your accounts in the fist column, and a list of which accounts are assigned to each exchange connection in the second column.</li>
            </p>
            <p>The viewing options are toggled by a pair of radio buttons. Accounts are downloaded from the Setup database, and data in the Account and
            Exchange columns is read only. Accounts assigned to the user are displayed in this section if they are configured as "Routable" in the Setup app. Accounts configured as "Non-Routing" are not displayed.</p>
        When the <b>Account</b> view is selected, it lists each account on a separate row and shows the exchanges available for the account in a comma separated list. The Account view is shown by default. Use the <b>Alias</b> column in the Account view to enter an alias name for identifying an account. When the account list is displayed in order entry windows and the <b>Account Settings</b> grid, the alias name is prepended to the actual account name in parentheses.</p>
        <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/global-accounts-alias.png"></img></p>
        <p>When the <b>Exchange</b> view is selected, it lists each exchange on a separate row with the accounts available for the exchange displayed in a comma separated list. In both views, if the data within a cell is too long to display, the text is truncated and shows a set of ellipses (...). Mouse hover over the cell to display a tooltip for the full text for that cell.</p>
        <p><b>Note</b>: The Exchange view does not display the <b>Alias</b> column, because the alias names are set per account and there may be multiple accounts on a single exchange row.</p>
        <p>To edit a routable account alias...</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Routable Accounts grid, select <b>View By: Account</b></li>
            <li>Double-click a cell in the Alias column for an account and enter an alias name.</li>
        </ol>
        
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4 id="account-settings">Account Settings</h4>
        <p>The <b>Account Settings</b> grid allows you to create your own set of default rules for mapping accounts to a contract. Use the <b>Add Rule</b> button to create a new row in the grid to add a mapping rule. The <b>Accounts</b> grid supports approximately 1,000 named and saved mapping rules.</p>
        <p>A new row displays asterisks for the <b>Product</b>, <b>Exch</b> and <b>Type</b> cells. A red border displays around the Account cell indicating that this is a required field. The first left hand column displays a red <b>X</b> button on mouse hover for the row. When clicked, the row is deleted and removed from the grid. The next column displays a checkbox that, when checked, includes the rule in the mapping process. The headers for both columns are blank.</p>
