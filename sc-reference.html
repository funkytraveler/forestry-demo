<h3 id="status">Strategy creation states</h3>

	<p>The <b>Status</b> field in the execution report panel provides the following creation strategy 
		states:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Submitted</b> &mdash; Indicates that the strategy has been sent to the exchange. </li>
	   <!-- <li><b>Order sent</b> &mdash; For FEX, this indicates that the exchange has received the strategy and the corresponding order simultaneously. </li> -->
			<li><b>Created</b> &mdash; Indicates that the exchange has validated and created the user-defined strategy and made it available to all market participants to trade. The user-defined strategy does not appear in the Market Explorer until the exchange creates the strategy and makes it available to 
				trade in the TT system.</li>
				<!-- <li><b>Resolving Instrument</b> &mdash; Indicates that TT is searching for an existing user-defined strategy.</li> -->
		<li><b>Exists</b> &mdash; Indicates that the strategy already exists at the exchange and is ready for order placement.
		</li>
		<li><b>No longer exists</b> &mdash; Indicates that a strategy that you previously created has been purged or expired by the exchange. You can re-seed the strategy legs and attempt to re-create it if you desire.</li>
		</ul>
