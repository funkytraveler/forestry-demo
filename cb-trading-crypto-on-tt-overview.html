<p>
  The TT&reg; platform provides users with access to crypto exchanges to trade a variety of digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.</p>

   <!-- <p>The platform provides access to trading firm users who are members of a trading firm, individual users who have their own "TT company" set up to trade on TT, or users who are not members of a firm but have their accounts managed by a trading firm on TT.</p> -->


  <p>TT supports the following types of users trading crypto on TT:</p>

   <ul>
        <li>Trading firm users (institutional traders) &mdash; These are users who are members of a trading firm, individual users who have their own "TT company" set up to trade on TT, or users who are not members of a firm but have their accounts managed by a trading firm on TT.</li>


         <li>CoinFLEX by TT users &mdash; These are users who are only interested in trading CoinFLEX spot and futures cryptocurrencies using the exchange GUI and the professional trading tools provided by TT at coinflex.com. These users are neither members of a trading firm nor being managed by a trading firm. TT users can still access CoinFLEX, as well as their other crypto exchanges, with a TT license.
