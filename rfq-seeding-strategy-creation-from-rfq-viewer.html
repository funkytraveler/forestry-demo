 <!-- <p>The RFQ Viewer allows you to act upon an RFQ for an instrument by seeding a Strategy Creation widget and configuring a strategy to submit in response to a potential market for that instrument. For example, if you receive an RFQ for a ES DEC16 Put contract, you can seed the Strategy Creation widget and create a Combo options strategy that includes the ES DEC16 Call options contract and submit an RFQ for this instrument.</p> -->


  <p><b>Note</b>: Before opening Strategy Creation, ensure that the <b>SC</b> column is shown in the RFQ Viewer. To show this column, right-click in the RFQ Viewer and select <b>Settings</b> | <b>Set RFQ Viewer columns</b> from the context menu.</p>

  	the <b>SC</b> column.</p>
