<p class="BodyOther">The Momentum Indicator identifies when the price is moving upwards or downwards, and by how much.. The Momentum indicator compares the most recent closing price to a previous closing price of any time frame. The Momentum indicator is regarded as an excellent gauge of market strength. A shorter period setting will create a more sensitive indicator, but will also increase choppiness and the potential for increased false signals.</p>

<!--
<ul>
  <li>The first is a crossing of the zero line. If momentum is negative and crosses the zero line to positive territory, it could be a buy signal. Note that this is only a valid signal when the line is crossed in the direction of the prevailing trend.</li>
  <li>The second event is a divergence with price action. If prices make lower lows but momentum makes higher lows, down side market momentum is declining.</li>
  <li>The third event is a very high or very low level of momentum, which may indicate an overbought or oversold condition. Since momentum is not indexed (constrained to move between 0 and 100) we must make a comparison to historical levels in that specific market to determine if it is overbought or oversold.</li>
  <li>Trend line analysis can also be used on momentum (event number four). Trend breaks in indicators often precede trend changes in price.
