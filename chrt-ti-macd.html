<p class="BodyOther">The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is based on the differences between two moving averages of different lengths, a Fast and a Slow moving average. A second line, called the Signal line is plotted as a moving average of the MACD. A third line, called the MACD Histogram is optionally plotted as a histogram of the difference between the MACD and the Signal Line. It is used to identify overbought and oversold conditions.</p>
<!--
<p>The Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD) indicator makes use of three moving averages, usually of the exponential variety. Two are averages of price and the third is an average of the difference of the other two.</p>

<p>The MACD line is generated from the first two averages, subtracting the longer from the shorter. The Signal Line is simply a moving average of the MACD line.</p>
-->
<p>Typically, a MACD line that has a rising trend and is above the Signal Line indicates a bullish market. Conversely, a bearish market is often indicated when a MACD line is falling and is below the Signal Line. Buy signals are given when the MACD crosses above the signal; similar to price crossing above a moving average. Sell signals are given when the MACD crosses below the signal.</p>

<!--
<p>Other analysis includes divergence with price action. While extreme values of the MACD line reveal overbought and oversold conditions, since MACD is not indexed (constrained to move between 0 and 100), extreme values must be relative to its own history.</p>

<p>Finally, crossovers of the zero line are also useful in determining trend direction.</p>
