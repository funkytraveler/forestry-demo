<p>TT's Autospreader gives you the flexibility to define synthetic spreads using custom formulas. You can also incorporate the real-time price of an instrument into your spread without quoting the instrument or using it to hedge In this video we will create a synthetic Cocoa spread using 2 instruments traded in different currencies and use a custom formula to convert them to the same currency.<p>
