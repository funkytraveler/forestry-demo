<p>The Volatility Calculator widget is used for calculating the Theoretical Value and Implied Volatility of an option at any underlying price. You can enter a Theoretical Value of an option to calculate its Implied Vol, or enter the option's Implied Vol to calculate its theoretical option price. For example, you can use the calculator to determine at what price you need to trade an options contract for a specific Implied Vol.</p>
