<p>The Conditional and OCO 2 TT public algos offer an option to use order building mode, which lets you dynamically build an OMA from existing or new orders. When watch mode is activated, the selected button and all MD Trader header panels are shaded yetllow to indicate that watch mode is active. You can then add or create orders to be managed by the OMA. New orders are added to MD Trader in a held state so they don't start working until the OMA is launched.</p>

<p>Also, custom action buttons that support watch mode can be added to any visible MD Trader widget. You do not need to add one to other MD Trader widgets whose orders you want to use in the OMA.</p>

<h2>Adding OMA buttons to MD Trader for Order Watcher</h2>
<p>Watch mode must be activated from a custom action button in an MD Trader widget. The custom action button must be assoiciated with a specific template for an OMA; you cannot use the default template for OMA algos you want to use in watch mode.</p>

<p>To add a custom action button for order building mode:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    From an MD Trader Order Entry panel context menu, select <strong>Edit custom action buttons</strong>.
    <p></p>
    Note: You can add the button to any MD Trader widget.
  </li>
  <li>
    Select the OMA algo, then select a non-default template. You can also customize the button text, if desired.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click <strong>OK</strong> to add the button to the current MD Trader widget.
