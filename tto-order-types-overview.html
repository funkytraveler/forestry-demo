  <h2 id="definition">What is a TT Order Type?</h2>
  <p>A TT Order Type order is a synthetic order that manages the submission and execution of other orders in the market. TT Order Types provide more robust order execution functionality than exchanges support natively. They offer order types not supported by exchanges or provide more options than exchange-native order types provide. TT Order Types offer the following features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Slicing large quantity orders into several smaller-quantity orders
    </li>
    <li>
      Entering orders in response to specific market conditions
    </li>
    <li>
      Scheduling orders to begin or end at a specific time
    </li>
    <li>
      Repricing orders based on desired market conditions
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>A TT Order Type order comprises two parts:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A synthetic parent order that runs on an Algo Server co-located with the exchange on which the instrument trades. The parent order manages the entry and execution of its child orders.
    </li>
    <li>
      Native child orders that are sent to an exchange for order execution based on the selected TT Order Type and its configuration parameters.
    </li>
  </ul>

<section id="lifecycle">
  <h2>TT Order Type order lifecycle</h2>
  <p>The basic lifecycle for a TT Order Type order is as follows:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      When creating an order, a TT Order Type is selected within an order-entry widget and its parameter values are specified in the order type fly-out.
    </li>
    <li>
      A TT Order Type order is submitted from the TT platform.
    </li>
    <li>
      A synthetic parent order is created for the TT Order Type on an Algo Server co-located with the exchange.
    </li>
    <li>
      The synthetic parent order submits child orders to the market as dictated by the specific TT Order Type.
      <p></p>
      In the <a href="ob-order-book-overview.html">Order Book</a>, the parent synthetic order is listed, followed by each of the child orders it sumbitted. In this example, the Order Book shows the parent TT Time Sliced order and the exchange-native child orders it manages.
      <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/tto-order-book.png" alt="" /></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A: TT Time Sliced synthetic parent order. Notice the <strong>Exch</strong> column shows <strong>CME*</strong>, which indicates the parent order is running on an Algo Server co-located with the CME exchange.
        </li>
        <li>
          B: Child orders managed by the TT Time Sliced synthetic parent order, along with the order type and status for each child order.
        </li>
        <li>
          C: The <strong>Type</strong> of the parent order matches the name of the specified TT Order Type.
        </li>
        <li>
          D: By default, a TT Order Type parent is submitted with TIF=GTC.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      As fills for the child orders are received, the parent order updates its working and filled quantities.
      <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/tto-order-book-fillqty.png" alt=""/></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      It also sends the fill acknowledgments back to TT to order entry and order management widgets, such as <a href="mdt-overview.html">MD Trader</a> and <a href="at-audit-trail-overview.html">Audit Trail</a>.
      <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/tto-fill-example.png" alt="" /></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A. Parent order fill
        </li>
        <li>
          B. Child order fill
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <strong>Note</strong>: When filled, a synthetic parent fill is reported â€‹for every native child order fill.
    </li>
    <li>
      When all of the child orders have finished working, the parent TT Order Type order is fully-filled and is removed from the Algo Server.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="tto-parameters">Configuring TT Order Type orders</h2>
  <p>Each TT Order Type displays a fly-out with its associated parameters when selected as the order type. You can enter the desired parameter values as well as save them as <a href="tto-managing-tt-order-type-templates.html">re-usable templates</a>.</p>

  <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/tto-param-flyout-mdt.png" alt="TT Order Type parameters"></p>

  <p>When using the Order Ticket, the parameters are displayed in an embedded panel. Based on the TT Order type, the panel might include tabs for additional parameters. For example, the following shows a fly-out dialog for a TT Bracket order type.</p>

  <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/tto-param-flyout-ot.png" alt="TT Order Type parameters"></p>

  <p><strong>Note</strong>: You can click <img src="Content/ot-tto-hamburger-icon.png" alt=""> to display the available <a href="tto-tt-order-type-templates.html">templates</a> and <img src="Content/ot-tto-flyout-icon.png" alt=""> to display all of the parameters in a <a href="tto-order-types-overview.html#tto-parameters">flyout</a>.</p>

  <p>A TT Order Type fly-out is organized as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The top section of the fly-out contains parameters that let you configure how the child orders should be entered into and managed while working in the market.
    </li>
    <li>
      The lower sections contain parameters that let you configure when to start working the parent TT Order Type order.
      <ul>
        <li>
          The trigger section determines the market conditions under which the parent order should begin submitting its child orders.
        </li>
        <li>
          The timing section determine when to start working the parent order and how long to let the parent order work. By default, the parent order begins working immediately when submitted and continues to work until it is fully-filled or canceled.
