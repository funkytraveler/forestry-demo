<p>The Aroon Oscillator is a derivative of the <a href="chrt-ti-aroon.html">Aroon</a> indicator that provides a different way to view the results. It is constructed by subtracting Aroon Down from Aroon Up. The Aroon Oscillator oscillates between -100 and +100 with zero as the center line.</p>

<!--
<p>A general bullish bias is present when the oscillator is positive and a bearish bias exists when negative. However, unlike other oscillators, divergences between indicator and price are not meaningful.</p>
-->

<p>The Aroon Oscillator provides the following signals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Above zero signals an uptrend.</li>
  <li>Below zero indicates a downtrend.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Formula</h2>
<p>\[Aroon\;Osc = Aroon\;Up - Aroon\;Down\]</p>
<p>The formula uses the following equations, where <em>n</em> is the number of days:</p>
<ul>
  <p>\[ Aroon\;Up = \frac{100 * (n - (Days\;Since\;n-day\;High))}{n} \]</p>
  <p>\[ Aroon\;Down = \frac{100 * (n - (Days\;Since\;n-day\;Low))}{n} \]</p>
  <p hidden>Aroon Down = 100 x (n â€“ Days Since n-day Low)/n</p>
</ul>
