<h3 id="aggregate">Price consolidation</h3>

  <p>You can consolidate prices at specific price increments by enabling the <strong>Settings</strong> | <strong>Price increment per row</strong> option in MD Trader. When enabled, aggregate order quantities between each price increment are displayed at each price level. For example, a price increment of "1" entered for XBT/USDT results in prices ticking in 1.0 increments.</p>

<h3 id="quantity-display">Quantity display</h3>

  <p>Quantities can be displayed with 0-4 decimals of precision using the <b>Quantity display decimal places
  </b> option in the <b>Preferences</b> | <b>General</b> tab. By default, this option is set to "2".</p>

  <p>A "+" is shown after the last displayed decimal to indicate additional quantity 
  (e.g., <img src="Content/gdx-display1.png"></img> ).</p> If the actual quantity equals your display 
  setting value, or if the remaining decimals are "0", then the decimals are displayed without the "+" (e.g., <img src="Content/gdx-display2.png"></img>. <!-- You can hover on the value to see the full quantity.--> </p>

<p>The following fields will adhere to the "Quantity display decimal places" setting:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <b>WrkBuys</b> and <b>WrkSells</b> columns in the Market Grid</li>
<li>MD Trader working order cells and <b>LTQ</b></li>
<li>The <b>Qty</b> column in Time and Sales</li>
</ul>

  <p><b>Note</b>: The Order Book, Audit Trail, and Fills widgets will show the full quantity regardless of this setting.
  </p>

  <p>If you click a formatted quantity when "Quantity display decimal places" is enabled, the actual, full quantity will seed in the appropriate widget field. For example, if you click "1.005+"" in the Net Open Position field in the MD Trader order entry panel, then "1.0051" will be seeded in the 
    order quantity field.</p>

  <li>The <b>NetChg</b>, <b>% Chg</b>, and <b>Vol</b> columns show 24 hour net change, percent change, and volume for the instrument.
 </li>
  <li>The <b>Settle</b> column shows the price in the final minute before the session rolls at 12:00 AM UTC (6:00 PM CST).
  <li>Detailed depth only shows price levels with working order quantities by default.</li>
  <li>The best bid and ask are highlighted orange when you have orders working at the inside market.</li>
  <li>Optionally, prices can be displayed with 0-4 decimal places. Any quantity above the displayed amount is indicated with a "+".</li>
