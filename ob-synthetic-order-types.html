  <p>A synthetic order is an order managed within TT that submits orders to the exchanges. Synthetic orders provide functionality that is not natively supported by an exchange. Synthetic orders consist of a parent order and one or more child orders. When a trader submits a synthetic order, that order becomes the parent order; all native orders submitted to the exchange are child orders of that synthetic parent order. TT supports a variety of synthetic orders, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ADL&reg; algos</li>
    <li>Aggregator orders</li>
    <li>Autospreader spreads</li>
    <li>Staged orders</li>
    <li>Strategies</li>
    <li>TT order types</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Order Book displays synthetic orders with child orders nested below the parent order.</p>

      <li>One child limit order managed by the ADL algo parent order</li>

      <li>Two child limit orders managed by the Autospreader ZBZN spread order</li>
      <li></li>
  </ol>
  <p>The Order Book allows you to hide child orders by collapsing their parent orders.</p>

  <p>The <strong>TTOrderID</strong>, <strong>ParentID</strong>, and <strong>Child Orders</strong> columns also provide information to identify parent synthetic orders and their associated child orders. </p>

  <ul>
    <li>All parent and child orders have a <strong>TTOrderID</strong>. </li>
    <li>Child orders also store the order ID for their parent orders in the <strong>ParentID</strong> column.</li>
    <li>Parent synthetic orders indicate the number of associated child orders in the <strong>Child Orders</strong> column, while child orders always show <strong>0</strong> in that column.</li>
