<!-- notes: <p>The Trade Schedules widget provides you with the ability to add specific exchange schedules to a Chart widget, or create and use custom product-level trading schedules when using the Chart widget. In a chart, You can use the exchnage's schedules or add your own custom schedule to determine which sessions to use when analyzing historical data in a chart.--> <!-- The exchange trade schedules are unchanged, as are the holiday schedules.(?) --> <!--Trading session and clearing session times are set by the exchange, but you can override these schedules on a per product basis using the Trade Schedules widget.</p>

questions:
what are the icons called at the bottom of the widget?
is there a way to select custom schedles that i have saved?

<!-- is this true? <p>Trade schedules start from the previous sessions close and end at the current session's close. For example, the Monday start time reflects the Sunday night open, and the closing time reflects the close of the afternoon session at CME (refer to the following image.)</p> -->

		<p> <img class="img-responsive" src="Content/chrt-trading-schedules-display.png"> </img></p>

<p>The image shows:</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>Schedule Name</b> &mdash; Shows the name of the exchange and product.
		<li><b>Trading Schedule columns</b> &mdash; The following columns are shown:
	<ul>
	<li><b>Active</b>: Indicates if historical data for the session is displayed in the Chart widget. When the checkbox is checked, the session is "active" and data is displayed. Click the checkbox to add/remove trading session data from the Chart widget. At least one session must be active. All trading sessions are marked active by default.</li>

			<li><b>Color</b>: The color shown for the session in the "Days active indicator" at the bottom of the widget.
					<li><b>Name</b>: The name of the exchange session or event.
					<li><b>Time Range</b>: The trading hours for the session. The minus sign "-" next to the time (e.g., -15:00:00) indicates that the trading session began the previous day.
					<li><b>Days of the Week</b>: Indicates which days are reflected in the Chart widget and the "Days active indicator" for each trading session.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

<li><b>Days active indicator</b> &mdash; Shows a visual display of the days and times a session was active. Each time range for the session is color-coded as indicated by the "Color" column. The "Days active indicator" changes based on which exchange sessions are marked "active" and which timezone is selected.</li>

</ol>




<h2>Trading Schedule Settings</h2>


<p>The right-click menu provides optional settings for viewing a product's schedule, events, and time zone in the Chart widget.</p>

		<p>In addition to the standard context menu options (e.g., Zoom), the following settings are available:</p>

<!--
<p>The right-click context menu provides the following historical data viewing options:</p> -->

<ul>
<li><b>Today/This Week</b> &mdash; Toggles between displaying data for the current trading day or the entire week. Click the option to toggle between the two settings.

<li><b>Trading Events/All Events</b> &mdash; Shows data for trading sessions only or all exchange sessions, market states, and events (e.g., Pre-Open, Auction, etc.). Click the option to toggle between the two settings. <b>Note</b>: When "All Events" is selected, non-trading sessions are grayed out but their time range is shown in the "Days active indicator".
 
 <li><b>Timezone</b> &mdash; Sets the timezone for the exchange sessions. The "Days active indicators" and "Time Range" columns in the widget reflect the selected timezone. Click this option to toggle between the actual exchange timezone for the sessions and the timezone on your trading device (e.g., workstation, mobile, laptop).
 </li>
</ul>



<h2>Using the Trading Schedule</h2>


<!-- When you open Trading Schedule to view historical data for an instrument in the chart -->
<p>When you <a href="#open">open a Trading Schedule</a> widget for an instrument, the Chart widget shows the historical trading data for that instrument based on the sessions active in Trading Schedule, and the "Days active indicator" in the widget shows the length of each trading session.</p>

<p>The following example shows historical data displayed in the Chart for all trading sessions of the ES Mar20 contract on CME.</p>
<!--	it shows the historical data for the trading sessions in the Chart widget.</p> -->

		<p> <img class="img-responsive" src="Content/chrt-trading-schedules-example.png"> </img></p>

<p>As you add or remove sessions in Trading Schedule, the historical data changes in the Chart. The "Days active indicator" also changes based on the timezone and exchange sessions selected. Sessions can be added or removed by using the <b>Trading Sessions/All Events</b> right-click menu option, or by checking/unchecking the <b>Active</b> column for a specific trading session.</p>

<p>For example, if you check the <b>Active</b> column for the Day Trading session (8:30 - 15:15) for the ES Mar20 contract on CME and uncheck the other trading sessions, then only data for this "active" trading session is shown 
	in the Chart widget. If you also click <b>All Events</b> in the right-click menu, the "Days active indicator" shows the time range of the active session in addition to all other exchange sessions for this instrument.
</p>

<!--
<p>For example, data in the Chart widget and the "Days active indicators" changes as different sessions are marked "active" in Trading Schedules for the ES Mar20 contract on CME.</p> -->
