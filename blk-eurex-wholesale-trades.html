<h2 id="eurex_cross">Cross Trades</h2>


<p>Eurex mandates that members send an "intention to cross" (ITC) message prior

participants.</p>

	<!-- <p>The Intention to Cross button and timer sends an "Intention to cross" message at a specified time interval prior to performing a cross trade. This message is broadcast to all market participants. Users have the ability to always send the ITC automatically prior to cross using the <b>Auto ITC</b> checkbox. -->

<p id="itc">Before submitting the order, click the Intention to Cross <b>ITC button</b>. This submits your cross request to the market and activates the ITC timer. Eurex sets the time limit to wait before submitting the matching cross orders. The exchange also determines how long the cross request is active.</p>
