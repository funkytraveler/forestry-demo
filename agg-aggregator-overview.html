	  <p>The Aggregator widget provides you with the ability to create a single aggregated instrument made up of multiple contracts and trade it as a single instrument. You can view an aggregated instrument in Market Grid and MD Trader, and you can trade an aggregated instrument with routing rules that determine where orders are routed.</p>

      <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/auto-agg-intro.png" <!--> </img></p>


        <p>Aggregator features include:</p>

	  <ul>
	  	
	  	<li>Smart order routing &mdash; Aggregator allocates the user's desired quantity across the leg instruments to achieve the optimal price based on user-specified configuration settings and server side best execution implementation.</li>
	  	
		<li>Rebalance &mdash; Aggregator allocates orders across the leg instruments, then continuously monitors all leg markets for liquidity that is immediately available for taking. When a liquid market is detected, Aggregator rebalances resting orders across the legs to take the liquidity based on the user-specified configuration settings.</li>
      
	   </ul>



<P>You can open Aggregator by clicking <strong>Widgets</strong> in the title bar. When the widget is minimized in your workspace, the Aggregator icon <img src="Content/agg-icon.png"> </img> appears in the title bar.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: In addition to using MD Trader, you can drag and drop aggregated instruments from the Aggregator Manager window to the Market Grid.</p>
