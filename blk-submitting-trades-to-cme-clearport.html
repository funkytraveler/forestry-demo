<div>
<p>Use the <b>Blocktrader</b> widget to submit OTC (over-the-counter) trades for your trading users registered with CME ClearPort. As an executing broker, you can select a counterparty and account for the entire trade or each side of the trade and submit both sides at once.  The available counterparties are associated with your ClearPort broker user ID and linked to your account with a ClearPort connection in the TT Setup application. When submitted, trades are routed to CME ClearPort.</p>

			<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/blocktrader-cme-widget1.png"></p>

				<p>Use Blocktrader to submit the following over-the-counter CME trade types:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Block</b> &mdash; Privately negotiated futures, options on futures, and CBOT swap trades between two eligible counterparties. Subject to CME Block Minimums Quantity validation.</li>

		<li><b>EFP</b> &mdash; Exchange for Physical. Exchange a position in the underlying physical instrument for a corresponding futures position.</li>

		<li><b>EFR</b> &mdash; Exchange for Risk. Exchange a position in an OTC swap or other OTC derivative in the same or related instrument for a position in the corresponding futures contract.</li>

		<li><b>LGNOT</b> &mdash; Large Notional Off-Facility Swap. An off-facility swap that has a notional or principal amount at or above the appropriate minimum block size applicable to such publicly reportable swap transactions and is not a block trade.</li>

		<li><b>OPNT</b> &mdash; OTC Privately Negotiated Trades.</li>

		<li><b>SWBLK</b> &mdash; Swap Block or Swap Execution Facility (SEF) trade. Subject to CME Block Minimums Quantity validation.</li>
	</ul>



		<p>In Blocktrader, trades can be saved as templates and used for submitting additional transactions.</p>

		<p>Once a trade is executed, you can view the fills and order status for each leg in the <b>Fills</b> and <b>Audit Trail</b> widgets. Block trades submitted via Clearport can also be viewed in the <b>Time and Sales</b> widget.</p>
	
		


<h2>Dual Symbology Support</h2>

<p>Optionally, you can enable ClearPort symbology within the Trade application for common CME Globex and CME ClearPort instruments.
Some ClearPort contract names use symbology that is different than what is used in CME Globex. For example, Natural Gas options 
(European) are listed as "LN" in Clearport, but listed as "LNE" in Globex.</p>

	<p>The <b>Use ClearPort symbology for CME</b> preference enables the Trade application to display contract names recognized by CME ClearPort. Check this option to enable the display of contract names using ClearPort symbology. When unchecked, contract names are displayed using CME Globex symbology. This option is unchecked by default.</p>

	<p><b>Note</b>: Reload your workspace after changing this setting to apply the change. To reload, select <b>File</b> | <b>Refresh</b> in the workspace title bar.</p>
