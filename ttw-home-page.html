    <li><b>Manage Workspaces</b> &mdash;  (Administrators only) Contains workspace templates created by a company administrator. As an administrator, you can delete, rename, or copy templates to new users in your company. </li>
  </ul>

The templates are pre-configured with widgets that may be used for different trading markets and trading environments.
