<p>You can upload <a href="pm-position-manager-overview.html#local">local manual fills</a> into the TT system using the import functionality in Position Manager. For example, options users that do not use Expiration Manager can track their futures positions from exercised or expired options by uploading their underlying fills into Position Manager. Uploaded fills must be in the <a href="pm-csv-file-format-for-uploading-fills.html">CSV file format</a>.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: Uploading manual fills for Autospreader parent orders is not supported.</p>

<!--
<p>Either local or administrator fills can be uploaded, but the ability to upload "admin fills" requires company administrator permissions in Setup. Uploaded fills must be in the <a href="pm-csv-file-format-for-uploading-fills.html">CSV file format</a>. </p> -->
