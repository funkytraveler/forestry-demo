	<p>The Time &amp; Sales widget displays all real-time and historical trades that occur for selected instruments and provides details for each trade including date, time, price, and quantity. Each trade is color-coded to indicate whether the trade was a result of an aggressive buyer or seller. You can configure each Time &amp; Sales widget to display one or more instruments on one or more exchanges, and you can specify quantities to only display and highlight trades of a minimum size.</p>

	<h2>Time &amp; Sales Data</h2>
	<p>The Time &amp; Sales widget keeps a running record of trades for selected instruments displayed in reverse chronological order.</p>
	
	<p><b>Note</b>: Users can access historical Time &amp; Sales data by scrolling to the bottom of the widget screen. The Time &amp; Sales widget on TT maintains and displays a history of trade data from all of your sessions and not just for the current session.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Each new entry is added to the top of the list, causing the widget screen to auto-scroll downward.</li>
		<li>If you manually scroll through the list to review older data, auto-scroll turns off.</li>
		<li>A red line at the top of the widget screen indicates you can scroll up to view additional information.</li>
		<li>To return to auto-scrolling, scroll to the top of the widget screen.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The <strong>Price</strong> and <strong>Qty</strong> column filters give you the ability to display only trades with prices or quantities that meet minimum and/or maximum values. For example, you can configure Time & Sales to show only trades with quantities between 5 and 20.</p>
