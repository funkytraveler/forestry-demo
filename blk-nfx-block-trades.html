<p>Use the <b>Blocktrader</b> widget to submit block trades for multiple accounts and counterparties at the NASDAQ Futures Exchange (NFX) and the NASDAQ Commodities and Derivatives Exchange (NDAQ_EU). As an executing broker, you can select a counterparty and account for each side of the trade and submit both sides at once.</p>


		<p>You can also create synthetic strategies to allocate multi-legged block trades in the order ticket of the Blocktrader widget. All legs of the strategy are sent to the exchange as separate trades. Strategies can be saved as templates and used for submitting additional block trades.</p>

		<p>Once a trade is executed, you can view the fills and order status for each leg in the Blocktrader trade log, which is located in the bottom half of the widget. The orders and fills are also displayed in the <b>Fills</b> and <b>Audit Trail</b> widgets. Block trades can also be viewed in the <b>Time and Sales</b> widget.</p>
