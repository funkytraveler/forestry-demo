title: Stochastic Oscillator (STOCH)
AccordionID: chrt-ti-stochastic-oscillator
---

<p>The Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch) normalizes price as
a percentage between 0 and 100. Normally two lines are plotted,
the %K line and a moving average of the %K which is called %D. A
slow stochastic can be created by initially smoothing the %K line
with a moving average before it is displayed. The length of this
smoothing is set in the Slow K Period. Without the initial smoothing
( i.e., setting the Slow K Period to a value of 1 ) the %K becomes
the 'Raw %K' value, and is also known as a fast stochastic.</p>
