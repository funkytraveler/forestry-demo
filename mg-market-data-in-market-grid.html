<p>The Market Grid displays market data for multiple instruments across multiple exchanges in a concise format. Users may add or hide columns to display various market data fields and can choose to expand the display of an instrument to display market depth.</p>

<h2 id="market-depth">Market depth</h2>
  <p>
  The Market Grid can be expanded to display market depth for one or more instruments to the extent that an exchange disseminates the data. When a row is expanded, the aggregated bid or ask quantity is displayed for each price level.</p>

  <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/mg-depth-intro.png"></p>
  

<h2 id="detailed-depth">Detailed depth</h2>
  <p>Some exchanges disseminate detailed depth allowing you to see every order at a price level. When a row is expanded to display detailed depth, you can see the quantity of each individual order at a price level to the extent an exchange disseminates that data. 

  {% include detailed-depth.html %}


  <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/market-grid-detailed-depth-2.png"></p>
  
  <p>When there are more levels of detailed depth available than can be displayed in Market Grid for a price level, the last row shows the remaining quantity in parenthesis.</p>
  
  <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/market-grid-detailed-depth-summary2.png"></p> 

  <p>For markets that provide detailed depth, the Market Grid separates direct bid and ask quantities from implied bid and ask quantities at each price level. When viewing detailed depth for these markets and products, the implied quantities are listed below the direct quantities and marked with an asterisk (*).</p>

  <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/market-grid-separate-quantities2.png"></p>



<p>The display of summary rows and prices at each level of detailed depth is configurable in the <a href="mg-reference.html#mg-settings">Market Grid local settings</a>.





<h2 id="live-only">Live-only mode</h2>
  <p>Market Grid supports a Live Only mode that allows you to hide instruments that are not currently being traded. When you enable Live Mode, the Market Grid displays only instruments that have an active bid, active offer, or last-traded price (LTP).</p>


<h2>Direct Prices</h2>
  {% include settings/direct-prices.html %}


<h2 id="implied-prices">Implied prices</h2> <!-- implied quantities only? -->
  <p>The Market Grid supports implied prices, which are tradable
   prices that are synthetically generated from orders in outright contracts and spreads. There are two types of implied prices:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Implied In &mdash; The spread market is based on orders in the market for the outrights. A bid or ask in the outrights implies a bid or ask in the spread for the two outrights. The difference of the outright prices goes into generating the spread price.</li>
    <li>Implied Out &mdash; The outright market is based on orders in the spread market. A bid or offer in an outright and a bid or offer in the spread implies a bid or offer in the other outright. The outright price is generated using the spread price and the price of the other outright.</li>
  </ul>

<!-- <p>The Market Grid displays the implied bid and ask order quantities for the spread and outrights markets and displays the implied prices based on these orders. For example, a 20 bid for ES Dec16 and a 10 ask for ES Mar17 implies a 10 bid in the ES Dec16-Mar17 spread, which is an Implied In spread order. An example of an Implied Out order is a 20 bid for ES Dec16 and a 10 ask for the Dec16-Mar17 spread implies a 10 bid in the ES Mar17 outright.</p> -->

  <p>The Market Grid displays the implied bid and ask order quantities for the spread and outright markets and displays the implied prices based on these orders. For example, a bid of 10 for the CL Dec16 contract and an offer of 5 for the CL Jan17 contract creates a quantity of 5 for the implied bid for the CL Dec16-Jan17 spread. The implied order quantity of 5 is displayed in the <strong>ImpBidQty</strong> column for the CL Dec16-Jan17 Calendar spread in the Market Grid.</p>

<!-- <p>Some exchanges disseminate implied in and implied out prices in their market data feeds. If these are not provided by the exchanges, the TT platform calculates the implied prices which can be viewed in the Market Grid for spread instruments.</p> -->
<!-- <h2>Indicative Prices</h2>
  <p>The Market Grid displays indicative or theoretical prices that are provided by the exchange. Indicative or theoretical prices are typically provided during pre-open or auction market states. If an exchange provides a pre-open or auction price, the value is displayed in the optional <strong>IndPrc</strong> (indicative price) column in the Market Grid.</p>

  <p>An indicative settlement price published by an exchange is displayed in the <strong>IndSettle</strong> column. For example, if an exchange sends an intra-day settlement price, it will be displayed in this column.</p>

  <p>To show/hide the indicative price columns in the Market Grid, right-click in the Market Grid, click <strong>Set Market Grid columns</strong> in the context menu and select <strong>IndPrc</strong> and <strong>IndSettle</strong>. For a description of the Market Grid columns, refer to <a href="mg-reference.html#mg-col-desc">Market Grid Reference</a>.</p> -->



<h2>Indicative Prices and Quantities</h2>
<p>The Market Grid displays indicative or theoretical open prices and quantities that are provided by the exchange. Indicative or theoretical open prices and quantities are typically provided during Pre-Open or Auction market states.</p>

<p> If an exchange provides a pre-open or auction price or quantity, the values are displayed in the optional <strong>IndPrc</strong> (indicative open price) and <strong>IndQty</strong> (indicative quantity) columns in the Market Grid. The indicative Bid and Ask prices for the instrument are displayed in the <strong>Bid</strong> and <strong>Ask</strong> columns during the Pre-Open or Auction market state.</p>

 <p>An indicative settlement price published by an exchange is displayed in the <strong>IndSettle</strong> column. For example, if an exchange sends an intra-day settlement price, it will be displayed in this column.</p>

<p>To show/hide these columns in the Market Grid, right-click in the Market Grid, click <b>Set Market Grid columns</b> in the context menu and select <strong>IndPrc</strong>, <strong>IndQty</strong>, and <strong>IndSettle</strong>. For a description of the Market Grid columns, refer to <a href="mg-reference.html#mg-col-desc">Market Grid Reference</a>.
</p> 



<h3>Resting Market Orders</h3>

 
<p>If provided by the exchange, quantities of resting Buy/Sell pre-open orders, as well as "On Auction" and "On Close" orders during Auction states are displayed in the <b>BidMktQty</b> and <b>AskMktQty</b> columns in Market Grid. The Bid market quantity (BidMktQty) column
 displays the total quantity of resting Buy Market orders, and the Ask
 market quantity (AskMktQty) column displays the total quantity of resting Sell Market
 orders.</p>

<h2 id="options-support">Options support in Market Grid</h2>
  <p>The Market Grid also provides market data specifically targeted for options contracts that you can expose by showing their columns in the grid.</p>
  <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/mg-options-columns.png"></p>
  <p>You can display the options values by showing the following <a href="mg-reference.html#mg-col-desc">Market Grid columns</a> through the <a href="mg-reference.html#mg-settings">Market Grid settings</a>.</p>
