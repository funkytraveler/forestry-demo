<p>You can request a log of user actions from the workspace "File" menu. When requested, the log file is prepared by back-end servers and can be downloaded via a link similar to a fill download request.</p>

	<p>The <a href="win-user-action-log-file.html">user action log file</a> includes actions manually initiated by the user such as "BuyClicked", "TickUp", or "CancelOrdersClicked". Automated actions initiated from Autospreader or Algo servers are not included in the file.</p>

<p>Files are created just for your user actions. As an administrator, you can also request log files for other users in your company.</p>



<p>To download a user action log:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Click <b>File</b> | <b>Download user actions</b> from the Workspace menu bar.

		</li>
		<li>In the <b>User Actions Download</b> screen, select the following options:

			<ul>
				<li><b>Most recent 24 hours</b> &mdash; Requests a user action log file for the last 24 hours. This is the default setting.
					<li><b>Date/Time range (local workstation time)</b> &mdash; Allows you to set a specific date and time range to collect user actions instead of the last 24 hours. The date and time picker allow you to set a <b>Start</b> time and <b>End</b> time for collecting data. TT supports requesting user data for the last 7 days.</li>
					<li><b>User</b> &mdash; Displayed only if you are an administrator. This option allows you to request an action log for users in your company. Only one user can be selected at a time. You can search for a user with a few keystrokes or select a user from the drop-down menu.</li>
					<li><b>File Type</b> &mdash; Allows you to select a format for the log file: Excel, CSV, or JSON.</li>
				</ul>
