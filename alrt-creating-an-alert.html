<p>Use the Alert Manager to open the Alert Detail screen, which is used for creating your own custom alerts. Using the Alert Detail screen, you can create logic that determines when an alert is triggered based on order activity, positions, and algo behavior. For example, you can create an alert for when your orders get filled, or when your P/L falls below a certain amount in all of your trading accounts.<p>

	<p>When creating an alert, you can also set whether to send the notification to your desktop or mobile device or both, as well as create your own custom notification messages.</p>


<p>To create an alert:</p>

	<li>Click <img src="Content/alrt-new-alert-button.png"> at the top of the Alert Manager.
