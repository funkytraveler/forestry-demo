<p>The Autotrader widget combines the functionality of the <a href="alg-algo-dashboard-overview.html">Algo Dashboard</a> and <a href="aut-autotrader-overview.html">Autotrader</a> widgets to let you deploy, launch, and manage algos built using various tools such as ADL and TT Algo SDK from within a single widget. Using Autotrader, you can configure multiple instances of an algo, modify it's settings, and select a co-located data center nearest the exchange to execute your algo. You can open the widget by selecting <strong>Autotrader</strong> from the <strong>Widgets</strong> menu. You can use the Autotrader widget to quickly set up and launch one or more instances of an algo. <!--In the Autotrader widget, you can enter values manually, copy them directly from an Excel spreadsheet, or <a href="exl-excel-linking-overview.html">create dynamic links for the values in Excel</a> to quickly set up multiple instances of algos for launch.--></p>
<p>After launching an algo, you can pause, resume and cancel one or multiple instances of the algo.</p>
