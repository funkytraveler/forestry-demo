   <p>You can configure the Positions widget to display your open positions and P/L by risk group, account, exchange, product, or contract by using the <b>Grouping</b> option in the context menu or the local <b>Settings: Positions</b> menu.
</p>

 
  <!-- <p>By default, the Positions widget groups your positions by Account as shown.</p>

  <p>To group positions, right-click in the widget and select <b>Grouping...</b>. For example, we can group our positions by account.</p>

<p>When grouping positions, you can also select <b>Top-level summary row</b> to display a summary at the top of the widget.</p>

 The summary row shows your overall position based on your grouping.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: When grouping by account, parent account positions also include their child account positions, so only the parent account net position is added to the total in the summary row.</p>


  <p>To change the grouping, click an option in the <b>Grouping...</b> menu (e.g., <b>Exchange</b>).</p>

  <p>By clicking <b>Grouping...</b> | <b>None</b>, you can disable grouping to display the positions in a flattened form as shown.

<h2>Displaying positions by risk group</h2>

<p>Risk groups allow your administrator to set risk limits for managed users or accounts from different companies in TT. When displaying positions by risk group, the <b>P/L</b>, <b>Margin</b>, and credit balance columns (e.g., <b>Balance</b>) are calculated independently of the accounts assigned to the group.</p>

 <!-- <p>If you want to exclude accounts without positions, you can uncheck the <b>Include accounts with no activity</b> widget setting.
