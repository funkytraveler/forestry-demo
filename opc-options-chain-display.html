   <p id="highlight">Through the <a href="opc-reference.html">settings</a>, you can also highlight potential trading opportunities based on the relationship between your theoretical values and the market. You can highlight a Bid/Ask price when the theoretical value approaches the market by a number of ticks. You can also display prices in gradient yellow shades based on how far through the market your theortical values have crossed.</p>

   <ol>
       <li>
           The theoretical value is highlighted white because the theoretical value is within a specified number of ticks of the market.
       </li>
       <li>
           The lighter shade of yellow indicates the theoretical price slightly crossed the market, so indicates a small edge at that price level. 
       </li>
       <li>
           The darker shade of yellow indicates the theoretical price crossed the market by a greater amount, so indicates more edge at that price level. 
       </li>
   </ol>
