  <!--  <h3>Setting Excel throttle limits</h3> -->
    <p>Excel automatically limits the rate at which it checks for updates. By default, it sets the throttling rate to 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds). In a fast-paced trading environment, such an update might not be sufficient. TT recommends that you disable the default Excel throttling rate by setting its value to 0. With this value, Excel continuously checks for updates, ensuring that you have accurate and up-to-date values.</p>
    <p>To set the throttle interval through the Excel object model: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>In Excel, open the Visual Basic Editor.</p>
       <p><b>Note</b>: If you need more information about opening the Visual Basic Editor, consult the Microsoft help for your version of Excel.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In the <b>Immediate</b> window (press <b>CTRL+G</b> or click <b>Immediate Window</b> on the <b>View</b> menu), type this code: <code>Application.RTD.ThrottleInterval = 0</code>, and then press <b>ENTER</b>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To verify that it is set correctly, type this line of if code in the <b>Immediate</b> window: <code>? Application.RTD.ThrottleInterval</code> and press <b>ENTER</b>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You can close the Visual Basic Editor, if desired.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Alternatively, you can set the the throttle interval directly through the Windows registry (For information about editing the registry, consult Microsoft help for your operating system). Set (or create, if missing) the following registry key to 0 (It is a DWORD and the value is in milliseconds):</p>
    <blockquote><pre style="width:auto">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Excel\Options\RTDThrottleInterval</pre></blockquote>
    <p><b>Note</b>: This example uses the path for Excel 2013. If you use a later version, you will need to use the appropriate version number in the path.</p>
