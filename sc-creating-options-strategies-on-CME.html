				(Options), product, contract, and select Put (P) or Call (C).
			</p>
			<p>Use either the Explorer or the Instrument Picker to identify the contract. The Instrument Picker allows you to set each part of the contract leg separately by clicking a field and selecting a value. 
			</p>

			<p><b>Tip</b>: Optionally, you can click <b>Templates</b> to select a structure that you can customize as an exchange-supported strategy.</p>

		</li>

			<li><p>Set the Side (B) and Ratio for the strategy leg.</p>  
				<p>A single click in the 
				<b>Side</b> column toggles a leg to the opposite Buy/Sell direction, and you can adjust the <b>Ratio</b> of each leg if needed.</p></li>

			<li>Click <b>+</b> to add each additional leg in the strategy as needed.</li>

         <li><p>For the second leg and each subsequent leg, click <b>Select</b> to choose an exchange (CME), product type (Option), product, and contract.</p>
       </p>Use either the Explorer or the Instrument Picker to identify the contract. Duplicate instruments in the same strategy are not allowed.

</li>

<li><p>Set the side and ratio for the strategy leg.</p>  <p>A single click in the <b>Side</b> column toggles a leg to the opposite Buy/Sell direction, and you can adjust the <b>Ratio</b> of each leg if needed.</p>

<p>For Futures legs, set a price and delta, which represents how many futures contracts you have to buy to flatten (or cover) your position in the options leg(s). For example, if you buy a 100 calls and puts in two legs, then your delta should be between 0-100.</p></li>



			<li>Optionally, uncheck (disable) <b>Clear legs on submit</b> to keep the strategy legs in the strategy definition grid when the strategy is submitted.</li>


			<li><p>Click <b>Create</b>.</p> 
				
<p>The user-defined strategy is sent to the exchange. When validated, CME publishes the strategy as an exchange-traded instrument for the trading session. If the validated Combo
 strategy is comprised of legs that fit the structure of CME's exchange-recognized spread
 types (e.g., Straddle, Strangle, Butterfly, etc.), the strategy
 displays with the exchange-recognized spread name in the execution report panel with a <b>Status</b> of <b>Created</b>.</p>

 <p>The user-defined strategies that you create can be selected as instruments using the <a href="win-search-overview.html">Search</a> box and the <a href="win-market-explorer-overview.html">Market Explorer</a>.
 </p>

			<p><b>Tip</b>: To save the strategy as a user-defined strategy template, click 
				<b>Save</b>. The saved strategy appears in the <b>Templates</b> list. </p>  </li>
