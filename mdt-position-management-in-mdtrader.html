 <h3 id="epiq">EPIQ</h3>
        

        <p>In MD Trader, you can view your estimated position in queue (EPIQ), which shows how many contracts are in front of your order at any given price. EPIQ is not sent from the exchanges, but is calculated by 
            TT based on the quantity of trades occurring in front of the order and is a conservative estimate of queue position that only reduces as trades occur. EPIQ is not reduced when orders in front of your order are canceled.</p>

        <p>The EPIQ is only tracked on manually submitted orders. Orders submitted by servers, such as child orders submitted by TT Algos, ADL algos, or Autospreader, will not have EPIQ values.</p>

        <p>When multiple users share an account, EPIQ is only displayed to the user who placed the order. Other users on that account will not see EPIQ for that order.</p>

        <p>EPIQ is enabled in <a href="win-reference.html#orders">Preferences</a>, and the EPIQ column is shown using the <b>Show EPIQ</b> MD Trader context menu option. When this option is selected, the <b>EPIQ</b> column displays the EPIQ values for visible orders.</p>

        <p>
         EPIQ is only displayed and tracked when an order price is within the visible displayed market depth. When viewing EPIQ, the EPIQ number displayed in the column is black by default. If your order is the first in the queue, the background color turns black and the EPIQ number "0" is white. If your order is at the inside market, the background color turns yellow.</p>

           <p><b>Note</b>: EPIQ is only maintained during the current logged in session. The EPIQ is cleared if you refresh or close your workspace, or if you logout. In this case, EPIQ values on existing orders will be lost and no longer tracked on those orders.</p>

        <h3>Average price of open position</h3>
        <p>The price ladder in MD Trader shows the average price of all your fills at different price levels. You can use this price point to gauge whether trading out of your position will provide you with a realized gain, loss, or scratch. If you are short, the average price of all your sells is shaded red in the price ladder. If you are long, the average price of all your buys is shaded blue in the price ladder.</p>
