 <p>The Risk Matrix widget consists of the following:</p>


 <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/trade-options-risk-matrix-display.png"> </img> </p>

<ol>
	<li>Account &mdash; Allows you to check your open position in a selected account (e.g., CME2).</li>

	<li>Product and Expiry &mdash; Allows you to select a product, underlying, or expiry in which you have an open position in the selected account. If two expiries have the same underlying instrument, you can choose to see the whole product (e.g., E-mini S&P 500), the options and futures that expire into the underlying instrument (e.g., ES Sep17), or an individual options expiry (e.g., Sep17).</li>


	<li><a href="#adjust">Scenario Entry</a> &mdash; Allows you to enter a global volatility adjustment for options risk and/or a price adjustment for the underlying futures contract. You can set the volatility and underlying adjustments as a percentage or an absolute value. When the scenario of all adjustments is applied, aggregate P/L and Greeks are calculated and displayed in the matrix for the selected account and product or expiry.</li>


    <li>Refresh button &mdash; Updates your position in the options and underlying futures contracts, and recalculates your position and options risk based on any underlying or global volatility adjustments added to Scenario Entry.</li>


	<li>Risk Metrics &mdash; Selector that includes risk metrics and options Greeks. In addition to <b>Mark to Theo</b>, which displays theoretical P/L calculated with the theoretical options value, the following options Greeks are available: Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Vega30, Vega60, Vega90, Rho, Delta Decay, Vomma, Vanna. OEV is also available if you have an expiry selected (e.g., Sep17). If you have a product or an underlying selected, it is not available.</li>


	<li>Matrix cell &mdash; Displays P/L for your open positions, as well as selected options risk metrics whose values are calculated based on the default scenario (-5,0,5) or custom scenario. Each cell displays values where the underlying future's price and global volatility adjustments intersect in the matrix.</li>

 </ol>

<!-- <h2 id="buckets">Bucket selection</h2>
<p>When a product, underlying instrument, or options expiry bucket is selected, the P/L and position for the corresponding options and futures contracts roll up into their corresponding expiry and product as follows:</p>


 <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/trade-options-risk-matrix-buckets.png"> </img> </p>

         <ol>
			<li>Product &mdash; Includes all expiries with open positions for this product (e.g., E-mini S&P 500).</li>
			<li>Underlying instrument &mdash; Includes options and futures that expire into the selected underlying futures instrument 
				(e.g., ES Sep17)</li>
		
			<li>Options expiry &mdash; Includes options contracts with open positions for a specific expiry (e.g., Sep17).</li>
		</ol> -->




<h2 id="adjust">Scenario Entry</h2>
<p>The scenario entry dialog box consists of the following:</p>

 <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/trade-options-risk-matrix-scenario.png"> </img> </p>
 <ol>
 	<li>Volatility &mdash; Allows you to determine adjustment scenarios for changes to Volatility. Your chosen intervals will be applied to your position and displayed in the left column. For example, a value of "10" in Volatility and unit of measure of "Absolute" represents a 10% increase in global volatility (the absolute value is actually a percentage when estimating changes in volatility). Negative values can also be entered to show decreases in global volatility. The adjustments can be entered in any order (e.g., -5, 0, 5, -10, 10).</li>

 	<li>Unit of measure (Volatility) &mdash; Sets an absolute value or percentage adjustment to global volatility.</li>

 	 <li>Underlying &mdash; Allows you to determine adjustment scenarios for changes to the Underlying Instrument. Your chosen intervals will be applied to your position and displayed in the top row. For example, a scenario that includes an Underlying value of "5" and unit of measure of "Percentage" represents a 5% increase in the price of the underlying future. Negative values can also be entered to show decreases in price. The adjustments can be entered in any order (e.g., -5, 0, 5, -10, 10).
 	 </li>

 	<li>Unit of measure (Underlying) &mdash; Sets an absolute value or percentage adjustment in the price of the underlying futures contract.</li>

 	<li>Control buttons &mdash; The <b>Reset</b> button restores the previously saved adjustment values. Click <b>Cancel</b> or 
 		<b>Save</b> to delete or save your adjustment settings.</li>

 	</ol>
