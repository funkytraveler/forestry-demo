        <h3>Centering the Market</h3>
        
        <p>When launching an MD Trader widget or adding a new instrument, the prices are centered
            around the mid-point of the bid/ask spread. That mid-point is indicated with a bold horizontal line. As bid and ask quantities change, the price column remains static unless the prices are
        recentered. </p>

        <p>You can recenter the prices in all MD Traders in your workspace by taking one of the following actions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            Right-click on the Price column of any MD Trader widget.</li>
            <li>
            Center-click on the Price column of any MD Trader widget.</li>
            <li>
            Press the spacebar on your keyboard with focus on any MD Trader widget.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        You can also configure MD Trader to automatically recenter based on a specified number of seconds in the Settings. This automatic recentering only causes the specific MD Trader to recenter.</p>
        <p>
            Any time an MD Trader is recentered, the bold horizontal line that indicates the mid-point of the bid/ask spread is reset.

        <h3>Reordering columns in MD Trader</h3>
          <p> You can move the following MD Trader columns: Work, Bids, Price, Asks, and LTQ. Click and drag a column to move it to a different location. For example, you
            can place the Last-Traded-Quantity (LTQ) and Working Orders (Work)
        columns side-by-side.</p>
