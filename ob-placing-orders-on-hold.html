<p>Placing a TT order type order on hold pauses the algo and places all working child orders on hold. Resubmitting a TT order type order resubmits its child orders and resumes the algo's behavior. Placing a TT order type order on hold is limited to orders with a status of <strong>Waiting</strong>, <strong>Pending</strong> <strong>Trigger</strong>, or <strong>Working</strong>.</p>
