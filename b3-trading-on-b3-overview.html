<h2 id="counterparty">Viewing B3 counterparty information</h2>



<p>
TT displays the counterparty code or name in the <b>AskMbr</b> and <b>BidMbr</b> columns in
 the Market Grid, Depth, and Time & Sales widgets.</p>

 <p id="detailed">In Market Grid, the counterparty code or name is displayed for detailed depth only. No counterparty information is displayed for aggregate depth. To display detailed depth, expand the contract row and check the <b>Detail</b> checkbox.</p>

  <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/b3-mg-counterparty.png"></p>

  <p>When you open or launch a linked Depth widget for a B3 instrument in Market Grid, counterparty information is displayed in the <b>BidMbr</b> and <b>AskMbr</b> columns.</p>

    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/depth-b3-display.png"></p>



<p>In Time and Sales, the counterparty
 code is displayed in the <b>AskMbr</b> and <b>BidMbr</b> columns for completed trades.</p>

   <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/b3-ts-counterparty.png"></p>



<h2 id="auction">B3 Auction and Pre-Open support</h2>

<p>Auctions are used in the B3 market for determining
 the market price of a contract by accepting bids and offers for
 a specified time period without matching. BVMF auction states are
 either scheduled (e.g., Pre-Open market state) or triggered per
 product or market condition during continuous trading (i.e., intra-day
 auction).</p>

 <!--Some triggers for intra-day auctions include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Prices entered outside of the auction band or price
 range defined for a particular product.</li>
<li>Intentional cross orders submitted for lower liquidity
 products.</li>
<li>Trading in specific products (e.g., Forward Rate Agreements,
 Options, IGM and IAP futures).</li>
</ul> -->

<h3>Viewing imbalance quantitiy</h3>

<p>Buy/Sell quantity imbalances during Auction states are displayed in the <b>ImbQty</b> column in Market Grid. The imbalance quantity is the difference between the Bids and Asks at a given price in the
 market, allowing you to determine if there are more buyers than sellers
 or more sellers than buyers at each price for a given contract.</p>

 <p>A positive value indicates more
 quantity on the bid than the offer, and a negative value indicates
 more quantity on the offer than the bid. Both quantities are highlighted
 using the Net Change Up/Net Change Down color settings.
</p>

   <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/b3-mg-imbalance.png"></p>


<h3>Resting Market Orders</h3>

 
<p>Quantities of resting Buy/Sell "On Auction" and "On Close" orders during Auction states are displayed in the <b>BidMktQty</b> and <b>AskMktQty</b> columns in Market Grid. The Bid market quantity (BidMktQty) column
 displays the total quantity of resting Buy Market orders, and the Ask
 market quantity (AskMktQty) column displays the total quantity of resting Sell Market
 orders.</p>

  <!-- <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/b3-mg-resting.png"></p> -->


<h3>Viewing Indicative Price and Quantity</h3>

<p>In Market Grid, accumulated quantities at the indicative price are displayed for Bid and Ask during Auction states. The quantities are displayed in the <b>BidQty</b> and <b>AskQty</b> columns, and the indicative price is displayed in the <b>IndPrc</b> column. Net change and P/L calculations are updated based on the indicative price when it's available.</p>

    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/b3-mg-indicative.png"></p>

<p>In MD Trader, the appropriate price column highlights the
 indicative price during the Auction and Pre-Open periods.</p>

<h3>Submitting Auction Orders</h3>

 <p>The “On Auction” and “On Close” time-in-force (TIF) order restrictions for Market orders are supported for equity products. You can submit Market On Auction and Market On Close orders using the Order Ticket from Market Grid.</p>

 <p>Market On Auction orders can be submitted during Auction states only. Market On Close orders can be submitted during continuous trading, but do not work in the market until the Closing Auction begins. When an auction expires, the unfilled quantity of the order is deleted at the exchange.</p>

  <!--Orders can be entered at any time during the trading day.-->











<h2 id="settlepu">B3 Unit Price support</h2>

<p>The Market Grid shows the settle price unit in the <b>SettlePU</b> column, which is a converted form of the settlement price.</p>

     <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/b3-mg-settlepu1.png"></p>


<p id="pl">The DI instrument price is an annualized interest rate for interbank deposits. Each rate has a corresponding unitary price (PU), which is the final value discounted by the interest rate adjusted by the number of workdays to expire.  At the end of each session, the exchange releases the settle denominated in interest rate and its corresponding settle in unitary price, which is displayed in the <b>SettlePU</b> column. P/L for the DI1 interest rate product is calculated using unitary prices.</p>
