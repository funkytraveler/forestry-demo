	<h3>Autospreader functionality for creating spreads in Spread Matrix</h3>

	<p>Using functionality from the Autospreader widget in the Trade application, you can dynamically create inter-product synthetic spreads in Spread Matrix by:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Entering an order from a floating MD Trader or Order Ticket for an inter-product Spread Matrix</li>
		<li>Using the <b>Edit spread...</b> context menu option for an inter-product Spread Matrix</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Inter-product spreads created from the Spread Matrix can be managed in the Autospreader widget, and they can be launched from the Market Explorer and traded like exchanged-defined spread instruments.</p>

	  <p>After entering the order, Spread Matrix creates a synthetic inter-product spread instrument that can be managed and edited in the Autospreader® Manager.</p>
