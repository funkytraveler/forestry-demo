	<p>TT Desktop is a front-end application that supports multi-monitor workspaces and provides the highest level of performance for accessing the TT platform. TT Desktop is part of TTâ€™s Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) delivery model and accesses the same back-end of the platform as TT through a browser and TT Mobile. No matter which interface you use to access the TT platform, you use the same login and see all of your orders, fills and positions.</p>

    <p>TT Desktop has the same look and feel as TT through a browser, but it does not run in a browser. It is a local application that requires a one-time install. TT Desktop workspaces are comprised of windows, each of which contain a collection of widgets.</p>

    <P>TT Desktop has been designed and optimized for desktop setups with multiple monitors. Users may create large, complex workspaces with multiple windows arranged across multiple monitors. Its multi-processor design allows TT Desktop to consume prices at a faster rate and provide a great user experience with no degradation in performance.</p>
