  <p>A synthetic order is an order managed within TT that submits orders to the exchanges. Synthetic orders provide functionality that is not natively supported by an exchange. Synthetic orders consist of a parent order and one or more child orders. When a trader submits a synthetic order, that order becomes the parent order; all native orders submitted to the exchange are child orders of that synthetic parent order. TT supports a variety of synthetic orders, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ADL&reg; algos</li>
    <li>Aggregator orders</li>
    <li>Autospreader spreads</li>
    <li>Staged orders</li>
    <li>Strategies</li>
    <li>TT order types</li>
  </ul>
