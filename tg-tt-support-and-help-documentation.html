<p>The TT help library and TT Support links can be accessed directly from the <a href="https://library.tradingtechnologies.com/trade/ttw-workspaces-in-trade.html">workspace menu bar</a> or home page. In addition, you can click "?" on each widget's title bar to open the <a href="http://library.tradingtechnologies.com/trade/wgt-widget-help.html">help page for the widget</a> similar to using "F1" in X_TRADER.</p>

<p><b>Tip</b>: If you need to report an issue, you can open an incident report directly from your open workspace.

<p>Click <b>Send Feedback</b> to open the <a href="http://library.tradingtechnologies.com/trade/wgt-feedback-widget.html">Feedback widget</a> to report issues to TT Support along with a copy of the widget in question or your entire workspace.</p>



<p><b>Note</b>: As needed, the TT home page and workspace will display a "Hello Bar" to inform you of events that may impact trading. The Hello Bar messages essentially replace the Customer Advisories you received on the X_TRADER platform.</p>

<p>In X_TRADER, order rejects and exchange issues are reported solely in the Audit Trail. On TT, in addition to displaying these messages in the Audit Trail, each open widget displays a "toast" message to inform you of any issues that may occur when connecting to an exchange or submitting an order.</p>
