<p class="BodyOther">The TT Cumulative Volume Delta (TT CVD Study)
displays a running total of net transactions as calculated by Volume
Delta. Transactions occurring on the Ask are considered Buying Pressure
and are added to the total, and those occurring on the Bid are considered
Selling Pressure and are subtracted from the cumulative total.</p>

        <h2 class="Blurb">Formula</h2>
<p class="BodyOther">TT CVD = Cumulative ( Vol &Delta; )</p>
<p class="BodyOther">Vol &Delta; = Difference between Bid Volume and
Ask volume over specified interval</p>
<p class="BodyOther">Bid Volume = - ( Accumulated Bid Volume )</p>
<p class="BodyOther">Ask Volume = + ( Accumulated Ask Volume )</p>
<p class="BodyOther">Buying Pressure = TT CVD &gt; 0</p>
<p class="BodyOther">Selling Pressure = TT CVD &lt; 0</p>
