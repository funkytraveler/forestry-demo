<p>A workspace is comprised of one or more windows that contain widgets tailored to your trading preferences. It contains a main window with the widgets you use to to view market data, enter and manage orders, and track fills and positions. You can create a single workspace for all of your trading, or you can create multiple workspaces with windows and widgets suited to specific trading needs.</p>

<p>After adding a widget to a workspace, you can drag the widget by its title bar to another location on the workspace. When you drag a widget close to another widget, it automatically snaps to the edge of the stationary widget to help you align the widgets. When widgets are snapped together, you can move them at the same time by using Ctrl + Left-Click on one of the title bars and dragging the widgets to a new location.</p>

<p>Each widget contains a set of icons in the top-right corner that allow you to minimize, maximize or close the widget. When you are done opening and arranging widgets, save the workspace by clicking the Save icon in the workspace menu bar.</p>


<h2>Workspace Window Menu Bar</h2>

  <strong>Note:</strong> In <a href="ttd-overview.html">TT Desktop</a>, the above items are displayed on the workspace main (parent) window. The menu bar for a 
  (child) window created from the main window is the same except it does not have the <strong>File</strong> and <strong>Edit</strong> menus, the Windows selector, and the <strong>Message Center</strong> and <strong>Lock</strong> icons.</p>
