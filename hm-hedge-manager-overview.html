	<p>The Hedge Manager widget displays all of your Autospreader hedge orders in a single widget and gives you the ability to act on unfilled hedge orders in various ways. You may cancel or modify a working hedge order directly in the widget, you may quickly launch an MD Trader, you may take quick action using a set of pre-defined action buttons, and you may attach an Order Management Algorithm (OMA) to manage an unfilled hedge order. </p>

	<p>As hedge orders are generated, they are automatically added to the widget. As hedge orders are filled or deleted, they are shown in italics and become inactive.</p>
	<p>If a spread defines post-hedge rules, those rules will continue to run, monitoring and modifying a hedge order according to its logic. For example, suppose a spread defines a post-hedge rule that pays up one tick if the quantity at a price level exceeds 100. If you modify a hedge order from that spread, such as paying up one tick, that triggers that rule action, the rule will then change the order by paying up another tick.</p>
	<p>Likewise, a post-hedge rule takes precedence over an OMA. If you launch an OMA for a working hedge order for a spread with a post-hedge rule, the OMA will stop managing the order if the rule modifies the order.</p>
