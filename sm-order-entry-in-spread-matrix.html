    <h3 id="calculations">Spread Matrix calculations</h3>
    <p>Spread Matrix calculates spread prices and quantities as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>For outright prices</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Spread ask - (Front-month ask) - (Back-month bid)</li>
          <li>Spread bid - (Front-month bid) - (Back-month ask)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Note</b>: This formula applies to calculating a commodity spread price. The formula reverses when calculating financial spread prices (ES, Russell) and currency (6E, Dollar Index). When buying those spreads, you buy the deferred and sell the near.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>For outright quantities</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the best price is in the outright, Spread Matrix uses the lesser of the front month quantity and back month quantity.</li>
          <li>If the best price is in the spread, Spread Matrix uses the spread quantity.</li>
          <li>If the outright price and spread prices are equal, Spread Matrix uses the lesser of the front month quantity and back month quantity plus the spread quantity.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
