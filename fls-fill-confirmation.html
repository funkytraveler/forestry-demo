		<p>Brokers or users who share an account can indicate to one another which trades/confirmations have been reported to a client by confirming fills in the Fills widget. Full and partial fills can be confirmed in either Detail, Continuous, or By Order mode. Synthetic parent order fills cannot be confirmed, but you can confirm the child order fills. Once a fill is confirmed, it cannot be unconfirmed.</p>

    <div>
	    <h2>Confirmed Fills Display</h2>

		<p>When a user confirms a fill, the following is displayed in the Fills widget:</p>

	<ul>

		<li>Confirmed fill rows display in a faded italics style, with the text color indicating the buy/sell direction of the fill, e.g., blue for buys and red for sells.</li>

		<li>A checked box appears in the <b>Confirmed</b> column if this column is shown.</li>

		<li>The <b>CurrentUser</b> column displays the user confirming the fill.</li>

    </ul>
