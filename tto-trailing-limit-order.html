<section id="overview">
<!-- <h3 id="tt-trailing-limit">TT Trailing Limit order</h3> -->
<p>A TT Trailing Limit order submits a native limit exchange order into the market then dynamically adjusts the price to stay within a specified distance of the market if it moves away. This means:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A Buy Trailing Limit sets the price a fixed amount below the market price. The order moves higher if the market moves above the highest recent price. The order will not adjust if the market moves lower.
  </li>
  <li>
    A Sell Trailing Limit sets the price a fixed amount above the market price. The order moves lower if the market moves below the lowest recent price. The order does not adjust if the market moves up.
  </li>
</ul>

<!--
<p>For example, if you want to create Trailing Limit order priced three ticks away from last traded price, you would specify the following TT Trailing Limit order parameters.</p>

-->

<p>The following describes the life cycle of a TT Trailing Limit order:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A TT Trailing Limit order submitted with a Start Date/Time is in the Waiting state.</li>
  
  <li>A TT Trailing Limit order goes into the Working state when the Start Time is reached or when the order is entered without a Start Date/Time. A single child order is placed in the market. The
  trailing parameters dynamically re‚Äêprice the child order as the market moves.</li>
</ul>
