<p class="BodyOther">The Moving Average Convergence Divergence
(MACD) was developed by Gerald Appel, and is based on the differences
between two moving averages of different lengths, a Fast and a Slow moving
average. A second line, called the Signal line is plotted as a moving
average of the MACD. A third line, called the MACD Histogram is
optionally plotted as a histogram of the difference between the
MACD and the Signal Line.</p>
