   <!--  <h3 id="mdt">Adding laser lines to MD Trader</h3> -->
    <p>MD Trader lets you add laser lines to the price ladder that provide visual cues for prices you consider important. When you paste a link from an Excel spreadsheet into MD Trader, a laser line appears at the approximate value of the link in relation to the price level. For example, suppose you use an Excel spreadsheet to calculate a set of theoretical prices that you want to use in your trading strategy. By adding laser lines at those values, you can monitor when the market approaches your theoretical price.</p>
    <p><b>Tip</b>: If you paste links from Excel and save the workspace, the links will be preserved and then restored when you re-open the workspace.</p>
    <p>To add laser lines to MD Trader:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>In the Excel spreadsheet, right-click on the cell containing the price you want to use as a laser line and select <b>Copy link to TT</b>.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Open an MD Trader widget for the desired instrument, if it is not already open.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>From the MD Trader context menu, select <b>Paste Link From Excel</b>.</p>

        <p>A red laser line appears in the price ladder proportionally within the price level associated with the value in the spreadsheet cell.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To verify the value is linked correctly, change the value in the linked cell in the spreadsheet, in this case to <b>2035.6</b>. The laser line automatically moves the to the new location in the price ladder.</p>
