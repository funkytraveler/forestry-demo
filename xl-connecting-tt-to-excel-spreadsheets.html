    <!-- <h3 id="connect">Connecting TT to Excel spreadsheets</h3> -->
    <p>To connect TT to your Excel spreadsheet:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Log in to TT, and open a TT workspace.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Start Excel if it is not already running.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>From the <b>File</b> menu, open the <b>Excel linking</b> sub-menu and select <b>Connect to Excel</b>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The first time you connect to Excel, TT displays the following security dialog:</p>
        <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/excel-allow-user-dialog.png"></p>
        <p><b>Note</b>: The dialog might be obscured by the Excel window, so you might need to collapse or move the Excel window to see the dialog.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Click <b>Yes</b>.</p>
        <p>After successfully connecting to Excel, a new Excel icon is added to the menu bar, as shown.</p>
        <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/excel-enable-icon.png"></p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Tip</b>: After the initial connection, you can enable and disable the connection to Excel by clicking the Excel icon in the menu bar.</p>

  Instrument section
  <div>
    <h3 id="instruments">Identifying instruments in your spreadsheet</h3>
    <p>When you reference instruments in your spreadsheet, you must use what is commonly called the short name to identify the instrument. For example, if you want to reference the CME September 2016 E-mini futures instrument, you cannot put <b>ES Sep16</b> in the spreadsheet cell; you must use <b>ESU6</b>. As different exchanges use different conventions to identify their contracts, TT provides an easy way for you to get the required instrument name to use in your spreadsheet. The ICE naming convention, for example, uses the short name, <b>BRN FMM0016!</b>, for the Brent Futures September 2016 contract.</p>
    <p>To get the short name for an instrument, open a Market Grid, select the desired instrument and type <b>Shift+Ctrl+X</b> to display the instrument data. You can then see the value in the instrument's <b>name</b> field.</p>
