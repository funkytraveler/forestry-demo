<p>Shows the underlying Futures contract price at which a holder can exercise their option to buy or sell the contract. The strike column reflects the range of the day by shading the strike. The high / low line indicators as seen on MD TraderÂ® are displayed in the strike column relative to their position.</p>

  <!--  <p>Strikes roll out of range as the market moves. For example, as Futures move higher, the higher strikes are displayed as the lower strike prices are hidden. Use the vertical scroll bar on the right edge of the Options Chain widget to find expiries that are out of viewable range. </p>

<p>Strike prices roll when the underlying is trading a full strike outside of the midpoint of viewable strikes. For example, if the extremes are 600 and 725 with midpoints of 650 and 675, the strikes will roll up and remove 600 while adding 750 when the underlying trades above 675. Strikes do not roll down unless the market trades below 650 or one strike below the trigger level that forced the roll. </p> -->
