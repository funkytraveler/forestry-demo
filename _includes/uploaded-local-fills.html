  <p>When you add a local fill and click <b>Publish</b>, the fills are only visible to you and not visible to others who share your account. Local manual fills are stored on your machine, so they do not appear in a workspace opened on another machine during the same trading day.</p>
  
 <p>Local fills do not affect any risk checks or limits that are set on the account, and do not rollover to the next trading session. These fills appear in the Fills widget with a status of "Local" in the <b>ManualFill</b> column. </p>
