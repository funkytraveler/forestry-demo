<p>The best bid and ask prices displayed for a product are based on the total bid and ask quantities, which include any implied bid and ask quantities. You can use the <b>Only show direct prices</b> setting for this widget to filter out the implied prices and quantities for each product added to the widget. Right-click to open the context menu and select <b>Settings...</b> to enable/disable <b>Only show direct prices</b>.</p>

<p>When the <b>Only show direct prices</b> setting is checked (enabled), implied prices are filtered out and only direct prices are shown, and implied bid and ask quantities are not included in the best bid and ask quantities. When unchecked (disabled), best bid and ask prices and quantities include both direct and implied values.</p>
