<p>For exchanges that support setting an "open" or "close" flag on submitted orders, the Open/Close button appears in MD Trader for the selected instrument. The flag indicates whether the order opens or closes a position. Click the button to toggle between "open" or "close" as needed before submitting the order. Working or filled orders with the flag set show either "O" (open) or "C" (close) in the <strong>O/C</strong> column in the Order Book.</p>
