<strong>Auto-Resubmit Upon GTD Expiry</strong>: Valid only when the child order TIF is <strong>Day</strong> (GTD). If any child orders are not completely filled by the session close, the exchange will expire the child orders; when the market reopens, the parent order will then resubmit the child orders with the same parameters as when they expired.
