<p>After submitting the order, the <b>ClearingAcct</b> column in the Order Book, Fills, or Audit Trail widget shows the value sent to the exchange as the clearing account. The <b>Account</b> column in these widgets shows the account you selected at order entry, but this account is not sent to the exchange if you enter your own exchange clearing account.</p>
