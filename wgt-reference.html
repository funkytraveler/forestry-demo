	<h2>Context menu</h2>
	<p>All widgets have a context menu, similar to the following, that can be accessed by right-clicking in any widget's titlebar. A similar context menu is also available from within the widget.</p>
	<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/wgt-titlebar-context-menu.png" alt=""></p>
	<p>This context menu contains common actions for widgets, as well as some actions specific to a particular widget, such as <strong>Enable Live Only</strong> in this example. Depending on the selected widget, the context menu will contain a subset of the following common menu items:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	  	<p><strong>Create group widget</strong>: Combines multiple widgets into a single <a href="wgt-working-with-widget-groups.html#create-group">widget group</a>.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  	<p><strong>Save as Custom widget</strong>: Saves a widget group as a <a href="wgt-working-with-widget-groups.html#saving-custom-widget">custom widget</a> that is added to the Widgets menu.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  	<p><strong>Clone widget</strong>: Opens a duplicate copy of the selected widget.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  	<p><strong>Send to</strong>: Moves the widget to another workspace window (shown only when the workspace has more than one window).</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  	<p><strong>Contact support</strong>: Opens a <a href="wgt-feedback-widget.html">Feedback</a> widget for contacting TT Customer Support.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  	<p><strong>Zoom</strong>: <a href="wgt-zooming-the-view-in-or-out.html">Zooms</a> the view of the selected widget.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  	<p><strong>Settings: <em>WidgetName</em></strong>:  Opens a Settings dialog to let you customize the internal settings of the selected widget or to define new defaults for all widgets of the same type.</p>
	  </li>
	</ul>
