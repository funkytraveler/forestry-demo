  <div>
  <h3 id="vol">Volatility</h3>
  
  <p>The Options Chain displays the following volatility values: Active (either user or fit vol), TTV (TT-calculated fit vol), IV (implied vol), SV (settlement vol). The <b>Active</b> column shows which volatility value is currently being used for calculating theoretical call and put values.</p>

  <p>TT calculates and stores volatility curve values that are used for shaping the volatility curve and determining the price of each option. These calculated values are displayed in the <b>TTV</b> column in the Options Chain and are used to fit the volatility curve to implied control points, which are used to normalize the shape of the curve.  </p>
  
  <p>If you modify the TT fit vol values in the <a href="vcm-overview.html">Vol Curve Manager</a> widget, the Options Chain will recalculate the volatility and display it in the <b>Active</b> column. The <b>Vol Curve Manager</b> will also fit the curve to the control points based on the user volatility values.</p>


  <p>The shaded strike prices in the Options Chain indicate control points on the volatility curve for the options month:</p>

The user defined volatility or TT-calculated fit volatility displayed in the <b>Active</b> column in the Options Chain is used as a variable in calculating the theoretical options values.</p>
