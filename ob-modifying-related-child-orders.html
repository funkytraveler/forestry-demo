	<p>Related child orders can be <a href="ob-modifying-an-order-in-the-order-book.html">modified using the Order Book</a>. The owner can modify the following for working or partially filled child orders:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Quantity &mdash; Changes to the child order quantity are allowed as long the total quantity of the parent staged order is not exceeded. </li>
			<li>Price &mdash; Allowed if the price change betters the trade (i.e., buy at a lower price or sell at a higher price).</li>
				<li>TIF &mdash; Changes can be made using the natively supported TIF restrictions.</li>
			</ul>
