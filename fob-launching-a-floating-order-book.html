    <p>If a collapsed instrument has working orders at multiple price levels for an instrument, you can launch a Floating Order Book by clicking the <b>WrkBuys</b> or <b>WrkSells</b> quantity. The Floating Order Book shows orders at all price levels for the instrument, as shown.</p>

    <p>You can set the Floating Order Book to sort orders based on how near they are to the inside market using the <strong>Sort price column by distance to inside market</strong> setting in
     <strong>Preferences</strong> | <strong>Orders</strong>. For example, if a collapsed instrument has working Buy orders at multiple price levels, the orders are sorted low-to-high in the <strong>Price</strong> column when this setting is enabled.</p>
