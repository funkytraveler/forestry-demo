<p>Use the <b>Copy</b> button in the Fills widget to copy selected fills and paste them into another application. The differences between copying fills instead of exporting them are:

	<ul>
		<li>The header row from the Fills widget is not copied.</li>
		<li>The copied fills are saved on your clipboard (similar to using Ctrl+C) and not sent to a separate file.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>To copy fills, select one of more rows in the grid using a mouse drag or Ctrl+left-click on each fill and click <b>Copy</b>. You can then paste the selected fills in the application of your choice (e.g., email).</p>

       <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/fills-copy.png"></img></p>
       </li>
