  <p>An algo or synthetic order is an order managed within TT that submits orders to the exchanges. A synthetic order consists of a parent order and the child orders it submits to the exchanges. <!--When a trader submits a synthetic order, TT creates a parent order; then, all native orders submitted to the exchange are child orders of that synthetic parent order. -->TT supports a variety of synthetic orders, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ADL&reg; algos</li>
    <li>Aggregator orders</li>
    <li>Autospreader orders</li>
    <li>Staged orders</li>
    <li>TT order types</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Order Book displays synthetic orders with child orders nested below the parent order.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>ADL Algo parent synthetic order. ADL algo parent orders show <strong>ALGO</strong> in the <strong>Exch</strong> column and list the name of the algo (<strong>Limit w Offset</strong>) in the <strong>Contract</strong> and <strong>Type</strong> columns.</p>
      <p>In this example, you can see that the parent order manages one child limit order.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>TT Order Type synthetic parent order. TT Order type parent orders show the exchange name followed by an asterisk (<strong>CME*</strong>) in the <strong>Exch</strong> column and the name of the TT Order type (<strong>TT Time Sliced</strong>) in the <strong>Type</strong> column.</p>
      <p>You can see that this parent order manages the three child limit orders shown in the rows below it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Autospreader parent order. Autospreader parent orders show <strong>ASE</strong> in the <strong>Exch</strong> column and the name of the spread (<strong>ZBZN</strong>) in the <strong>Contract column</strong></p>
      <p>Here, you can see that the parent order manages the two child limit orders below it.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <ol type="A" hidden>
    <li>One child limit order managed by the ADL algo parent order</li>
    <li>Three child limit orders managed by the TT Time Sliced order type</li>
    <li>Two child limit orders managed by the Autospreader ZBZN spread order</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The Order Book allows you to hide child orders by collapsing their parent orders.</p>

  <p>The <strong>TTOrderID</strong>, <strong>ParentID</strong>, and <strong>Child Orders</strong> columns also provide information to identify parent synthetic orders and their associated child orders. </p>
  <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/ob-parent-child-columns.png" alt=""></p>
  <ol>
    <li>All parent and child orders have a <strong>TTOrderID</strong>. </li>
    <li>Child orders also show the order ID for their parent orders in the <strong>ParentID</strong> column.</li>
    <li>The <strong>Child Orders</strong> column displays the number of child orders being managed by each parent synthetic order. Child orders always show <strong>0</strong> in this column.</li>
