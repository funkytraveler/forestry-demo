 </p>

<p><b>Tip</b>: As an administrator, click the drop down arrow in the "Add Profile" button to create an admin-controlled profile.</p>

	</li>
	<li>Enter a new name the profile.

		<p>Duplicate profile names are not 
		allowed. The name also appears in the <b>Profile</b> column in the rules panel.</p></li>

		<li><p>In the <b><i>applies these fields</i></b> section in the rule panel, double-click the cell in each column to enter a value. </p>



			<p>The default settings display asterisks for the Prod, Exch, Group, and Type cells and cannot be edited. Refer to <a href="op-reference.html">Order Profiles Reference</a> for a description of each column.</p></li>

		<li><p>To add a rule to the profile, click <b>Add Rule</b> and double-click a cell in <a href="op-reference.html">each column</a> to add values as needed.
		</p></li>

				 <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/order-profiles-cell-behavior.png"> </img></p>

				 <p><b>Tip</b>: Drag the mouse across multiple cells to define the same behavior for each one.</p>

				<p>Select one of the following:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><b>Clear existing value when profile is applied</b> &mdash; Allows the field value to be overwritten at order entry when a different profile is selected.</li> <!-- seems redundant? the default beahvior is overwrite?! -->

					<li><b>Preserve existing value when profile is applied</b> &mdash; Keeps the existing field value at order entry when a different profile is selected. When this option is selected, the "pass-through" icon <img src="Content/order-profiles-icon.png"> </img>appears in the field.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><b>Note</b>: By default, neither option is active and if a cell has a value, the field gets set to that value at order entry. If a cell is blank in the Order Profile selected at order entry, the previous value in that field is cleared unless that cell is configured with the <b>Preserve existing value when profile is applied</b> option.</p>

				</li>


				<li> <p>Check the <b>Use</b> column to include the rule in finding a best match for order 
				entry.</p></li>
