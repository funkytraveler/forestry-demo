		<li><a href="#customer">Customer Defaults</a>
		<li><a href="#order">Order Defaults</a>
			<!-- <li><a href="#rules">Routing Rules</a> -->

</ul>



<p>In addition, you can also <a href="#switch">switch trading environments</a> and <a href="tg-tt-support-and-help-documentation.html">contact technical support and open help library topics</a> all from within your customized TT workspace.</p>

<h2 id="switch">Switching environments</h2>

<p>If you wanted access to a different customer environment on X_TRADER, you had to enter the new multicast IP address in Guardian and manually restart your Guardian and TTM services on your client workstation. For trading in the Simulation environment, you had to ensure that the minimum client applications required for the additional TT SIM software package were installed on your machine.</p>

<p>On TT, you can easily <a href="http://library.tradingtechnologies.com/trade/win-changing-trading-environments.html">switch between Live and Simulation trading environments</a> from your TT workspace or home page without needing to log out of one environment to log in to the other.</p>

<h2 id="global">Global Properties vs. Preferences</h2>

<p>Many of the same global properties in X_TRADER are provided in the <a href="http://library.tradingtechnologies.com/trade/ttw-user-preferences.html">Preferences</a> screen in your TT workspace by clicking <b>Edit</b> | <b>Preferences</b>.</p>

<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/tg-preferences.png" alt=""/></a></p>


<p>TT separates customization settings into user preferences and widget-specific settings. <a href="https://library.tradingtechnologies.com/trade/ttw-user-preferences.html">User preferences</a> are accessed by selecting <strong>Preferences</strong> from the workspace <strong>Edit</strong> menu.</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/wrk-preferences-general.png" alt=""/></p>





<h2>Widget Settings vs. Window Settings</h2>

<p>Settings for widgets can be accessed through the widget's right-click context menu (e.g., MD Trader).</p>

	<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/mdt-settings-context.png" alt=""/></p>


<p>The following shows the <a href="http://library.tradingtechnologies.com/trade/mdt-reference.html">Settings</a> for the MD Trader widget.</p>

<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/mdt-settings.png" alt=""/></p>



<ul>
  <li>The <strong>Settings</strong> tab lets you customize only the current instance of a widget.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Defaults</strong> tab lets you change the look, feel and behavior of all active instances of the widget as well as all instances opened in the future.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="risk">Risk Parameters vs. Risk Settings</h2>

<p>Similar to the risk parameters functionality in X_TRADER, you can open the <a href="http://library.tradingtechnologies.com/user-setup/gs-introduction-to-setup.html">Setup</a> application in TT from within your workspace to check your risk settings. You can view which markets and products you have access to, check margin values per contract, and view your daily credit limit and position limits assigned to your accounts and username.
</p>

<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/tg-setup.png" alt=""/></a></p>





<h2 id="customer">Customer Defaults vs. Order Profiles</h2>


<p>In TT, your X_TRADER customer defaults can be created as "order tag defaults" and given a profile name by administrators in Setup. For example, Customer defaults can be set up per account or customer, and define values for specific fields like MiFID II fields.</p>

	<p>In your TT workspace, you can select and customize default account and order settings using the <a href="http://library.tradingtechnologies.com/trade/op-order-profiles-overview.html">Order Profiles</a> widget in your TT workspace. Similar to Customer Defaults, order parameters can be set up per account or customer, and include values for specific fields (e.g., MiFID II).</p>

<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/tg-order-profiles.png" alt=""/></a></p>




<h2 id="order">Order Defaults vs. Templates</h2>

<p>In X_TRADER, the Order Defaults window is used to define order templates, which allow you to establish custom order variables for synthetic orders. In TT, <a href="https://library.tradingtechnologies.com/trade/tto-managing-tt-order-type-templates.html">templates</a> are used to save custom order variables for submitting synthetic orders using TT order types.<p>


<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/tto-create-template.png" alt="Create Template"></a></p>



<!-- <h2 id="rules">Routing Rules in X_TRADER vs. Tiered Risk in TT</h2>

<p>You can request that different brokers <a href="http://library.tradingtechnologies.com/user-setup/co-user-and-company-interactions.html#account">share their TT accounts</a> and market access with your company using the Setup application. For example, a broker can share an omnibus account with your company, then your administrator would add order routing sub-accounts under the shared account with connections to the requested market.</p>

 <p>On TT, currently a single order cannot be split and routed among multiple accounts similar to how a single order can be split among different brokers in X_TRADER.</p> -->







<!-- <h2>Login Gateways</h2>


<p>By default, TT provides the same functionality as X_TRADER ASP, so you do not need to manually select TT Gateways that are routing orders to specific brokers, and no manual TT Gateway installations and configurations are necessary to access a market. On TT, you can route orders to different brokers and markets using parent accounts and child sub-accounts configured in Setup.
</p> -->



<!-- <h3>How do I change environments on TT?</h3>

<p>If you wanted access to a different customer environment on X_TRADER, you had to enter the new multicast IP address in Guardian and manually restart your Guardian and TTM services on your client workstation. For trading in the Simulation environment, you had to ensure that the minimum client applications required for the additional TT SIM software package were installed on your machine.</p>

	<p>On TT, you can easily <a href="http://library.tradingtechnologies.com/trade/win-changing-trading-environments.html">switch between Live and Simulation trading environments</a> from your TT workspace or home page without needing to log out of one environment to log in to the other.</p>
