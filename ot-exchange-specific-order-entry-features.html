<h2 id="ice-eurex-eex">ICE, Eurex, and EEX</h2>

<h2 id="mifid">MiFID II exchanges</h2>
<p>For exchanges that need to comply with the MiFID II regulations, the <strong>Show order entry compliance fields</strong> setting in the <strong>Orders</strong> section of <a href="prf-orders-preferences.html#cdi">Preferences</a> can be enabled to add compliance fields to the Order Ticket.</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/ot-cdi-dropdown.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The items added include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>CDI</strong> (Commodity Derivative Indicator) dropdown that lets a user report whether a trade is reducing risk, also referred to as a hedging trade. The dropdown supports the following choices:
<ul>
  <li><strong>&lt;CDI&gt;</strong>: Use the value defined in Setup.</li>
  <li><strong>CDI Yes</strong>: This order is a hedging trade.</li>
  <li><strong>CDI No</strong>: This order is not a hedging trade.</li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Invest Decision</strong> field for the short code identifying who made the trading decision.</li>
  <li><strong>Exec Decision</strong> field  for the short code identifying who or what algo is submitting the order.</li>
  <li><strong>Client ID</strong> field for the short code identifying the customer.</li>
</ul>


<p>If specified, these values override the default order profile settings defined in Setup.<!-- The dropdown supports the following choices:--></p>
<!--
<ul>
  <li><strong>&lt;CDI&gt;</strong>: Use the value defined in Setup</li>
  <li><strong>CDI Yes</strong>: This order is a hedging trade</li>
  <li><strong>CDI No</strong>: This order is not a hedging trade</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="brokertec">BrokerTec</h2>
<p>The BrokerTec exchange supports passive and aggressive orders. To support this functionality for BrokerTec orders, an Order Ticket replaces the <b>Buy</b> and <b>Sell</b> buttons with buttons for entering passive or aggressive orders.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Aggressive orders hit or take passive orders in the market. An order is aggressive when a bid is hit or an offer is taken; the order must be on the inside market. Submit aggressive orders using the <b>HIT</b> or <b>TAKE</b> buttons.</li>
    <li>Passive orders rest in the market waiting for an aggressive order to hit or take them. An order is passive when a resting bid or offer is placed in the market. Submit passive orders using the <b>BID</b> or <b>OFFER</b> buttons.</li>
</ul>

    <!-- <p>If the cross orders are natively supported by an exchange, the <b>Cross</b> order type appears in the Order Types field in the Order Ticket. -->
    <p>The Order Ticket supports submitting block trades at the following exchange: <a href="http://www.eurexchange.com/exchange-en/products/eurex-trade-entry-services/block-trades">EEX</a>.</p>
