<h3>RFQ Support for CME</h3>
<p>The RFQ Viewer provides you with the ability to monitor and act upon <a href="http://www.cmegroup.com/education/request-for-quote.html">RFQs for CME</a> options strategies and instruments. Multi-legged options spreads can be created and modified using the Strategy Creation widget or Options Chain. You can then submit an RFQ for these unique, user-defined options strategies to create a market for the instrument. Your RFQ and any bids and offers that you receive for the instrument can be monitored and acted upon in the RFQ Viewer.</p>
