<p>The owner who claimed the care order can enter related child orders to fill the parent order. Child orders are sent to the exchange based on the total quantity, price and position of the parent care order, and can be submitted in the same account or different accounts.
 </p>


<p>Child orders can be submitted simultaneously or at different times, allowing the staged
 order to be worked based on market conditions. The owner can submit child orders using TT order types in addition to the natively supported order types and TIFs. Native order types and TIFs vary by exchange.</p>


<p>When submitting a child order for a claimed care order, the owner <i>cannot</i>:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Reverse the Buy/Sell direction of the order.</li>
		<li>Exceed the parent order quantity. However, the related child order quantity can be increased as long as it doesn't exceed the parent order quantity.</li>


			<li>Change the instrument specified in the order.</li>
		</ul>

 	<!-- <p><b>Note</b>: If the execution account has the "Only allow price improvements on child orders" setting enabled by the administrator, the owner cannot change the price of the parent order.</p> -->


	<p>To submit related child orders:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Select the care order in the Order Book.</li>
	

	<li><p>Click the <b>B</b> (Buy) or <b>S</b> (Sell) button in the <b>B/S</b> column for the care order.</p>
		<!-- <p>Your floating
 order entry widget of choice (in this example, the Order Ticket) opens seeded with the staged order details. The floating order widget only shows one side of the trade based on whether the parent staged order is a Buy or a Sell order: the Order Ticket will only show either the Buy or Sell button, and MD Trader will gray out either the Buy side or Sell side of the price ladder.</p> -->

 <p>The Order Ticket opens seeded with the care order details, and shows either the Buy or Sell button based on whether the 
 	parent order is a Buy or a Sell order.</p>

</li>

 <li>Enter the <a href="https://library.tradingtechnologies.com/trade/ot-order-entry-from-order-ticket.html">order parameters and account in the Order Ticket</a> as needed. 

 	<p>If using an order profile, the account configured in the profile will be used to submit the order. This can be a different account or the same account as the originator.</p>

<p>All native exchange order types and TT synthetic order types are supported when submitting a child order. <!-- ADL algos and Autospreader synthetic spreads are also supported.--> </p>

 </li>

    <li><p>Click the single <b>BUY</b> or <b>SELL</b> button in the Order Ticket to submit the child order to the exchange.</p>
    <!--	<p>In MD Trader, click either the <b>Bids</b> or <b>Asks</b> column next to a price level to enter the order.</p> -->

 <p><b>Tip</b>: Click the expander (+) in the working care order row in the Order Book to show all working or filled child orders, as well as show fills assigned to the parent order.</p>
