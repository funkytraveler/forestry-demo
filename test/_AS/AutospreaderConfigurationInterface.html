 <p>The Autospreader Configuration dialog box provides you with the parameters and settings to configure a synthetic spread and control its behavior as it trades. The dialog box opens after clicking <b>Create</b> or <b>Edit</b> in the Autospreader Manager.</p>

            <p>In these panes you can configure the legs of your spread, indicate how to build the synthetic book, configure trade ratios, and preview your spread before launching it into the market. You can also view the calculated tick size based on the contract tick size and Spread Multiplier of the legs, or override it with your own. Use the ticking fields to review the ticking relationship between the selected products and the effect on the spread with a one-tick move in an outright leg. You can also add available quoting and hedging rules to the legs of your spread using the <b>Rules</b> field.</p>
