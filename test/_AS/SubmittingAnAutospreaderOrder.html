   <p>You submit a spread order the same way you submit an order for an exchange-traded instrument. For example, you can submit the spread order in an <a href="order-entry-mdt.html">MD Trader</a> widget by specifying the quantity and clicking a price level, as shown. In this example, the spread is configured to submit quoting orders for both legs.</p><p class="notes">Update links</p>

          <p>You can also use supported TT Algos, such as TT Iceberg, to manage an Autospreader order. Simply select the desired TT Algo from the order type drop-down.</p>
