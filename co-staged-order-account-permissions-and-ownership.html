	<!-- <h3>Staged order account permissions and ownership</h3> -->
	<p>The risk administrator at your firm sets the <a href="https://library.tradingtechnologies.com/user-setup/ac-staged-order-permissions.html">order permissions for submitting and managing care orders</a> per account or user. The risk administrator also configures risk settings for the execution accounts used for submitting child orders related to the parent care order.</p>

	<p>The account used for staging the order can be assigned to multiple users in the same company or shared with users in a different company. If a user will be staging an order into an account that needs visibility outside of your company, the account needs to be shared using using the Setup application in TT.</p>

		<!-- <p>The accounts used by originators and owners for submitting and viewing staged orders are not required to have live market data or connections assigned. If this is the case, the owner who claims the staged order can have a separate account with connections and native order permissions for executing child orders to fill the parent staged order.</p> -->

	<p><b>Note</b>: You can stage orders or submit manual fills for these orders using accounts without active connections configured in Setup. These "stage only" accounts must also have order permissions set for submitting and/or managing staged (care) orders.</p>


		<p>The following table shows the order actions allowed for users based on their care order and execution account ownership.  </p>

	<p>If the owner claiming the care order uses their own accounts to submit child orders, the originator will not have visibility of the owner's accounts. However, fills from the execution accounts will be visible to the originator in the care order

	<p>The risk limits on the ownerâ€™s execution accounts, as well as any parent accounts of those execution accounts, are checked when the owner submits child orders in those accounts on behalf of a care order.</p>
