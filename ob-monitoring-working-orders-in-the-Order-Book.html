<p>You can use this widget to see a list of your orders currently working in the market. For each order, you can monitor things like the working quantity, order type, percent filled, and so on.</p>

<p>You can quickly switch between viewing all orders, only working orders and only fills. For example, to show only working orders, click <strong>Working</strong>.</p>

<p>You can also filter the list based on values in one or more columns. If you hover the mouse cursor over the right side of a column title, the cursor changes to a hand to let you know you can use it to change the filter. For example, you can filter the display orders by contract by hovering over the <b>Contract</b> column and clicking the drop-down arrow.</p>

<p>You can also sort your orders by values in a column by clicking the column. Each time you click a column, the sorting switches between ascending, descending, and unsorted. For example, the first time you clicked the <b>Account</b> column, the orders would be sorted in ascending order by the <b>Account</b> column value; the second time you click the column, the orders would be sorted in descending order; and the third click would turn off sorting for the column values.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Partial fills are highlighted yellow in the <strong>ExeQty</strong> column in the Order Book widget and the Order Book pane in the Orders and Fills widget.</p>
