<h2 id="create">Using a stand-alone Strategy Creation widget</h2>

 <p>To create a strategy using a stand-alone Strategy Creation widget:</p>

		<ol>

			<li>In an opened Strategy Creation widget, select an exchange and account using the exchange and account selectors at the top left corner of the widget.</li>
			<li><p>For the first leg, click <b>Select</b> and choose a product type 
				(e.g., Options), product, expiry, and select Put (P) or Call (C).
			</p>
			<p>Use either the Explorer or the Instrument Picker to identify the contract. The Instrument Picker allows you to set each part of the contract leg separately by clicking a field and selecting a value. 
			</p>

			<p><b>Tip</b>: Optionally, you can click <b>Templates</b> to select a structure that you can customize as an exchange-supported strategy.</p>

		</li>

			<li><p>Set the Side (B) and Ratio for the strategy leg.</p>  
				<p>A single click in the 
				<b>Side</b> column toggles a leg to the opposite Buy/Sell direction, and you can adjust the <b>Ratio</b> of each leg if needed.</p></li>

			<li>Click <b>+</b> to add each additional leg in the strategy as needed.</li>

         <li><p>For the second leg and each subsequent leg, click <b>Select</b> to choose an exchange (CME), product type (Option), product, and contract.</p>
       </p>Use either the Explorer or the Instrument Picker to identify the contract. Duplicate instruments in the same strategy are not allowed.
        </p>

        	<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/trade-strategy-create1.png" alt=""></p>

</li>

<li><p>Set the side and ratio for the strategy leg.</p>  <p>A single click in the <b>Side</b> column toggles a leg to the opposite Buy/Sell direction, and you can adjust the <b>Ratio</b> of each leg if needed.</p>

<p>For Futures legs, set a price and delta, which represents how many futures contracts you have to buy to flatten (or cover) your position in the options leg(s). For example, if you buy a 100 calls and puts in two legs, then your delta should be between 0-100.</p></li>



			<li>Optionally, uncheck (disable) <b>Clear legs on submit</b> to keep the strategy legs in the strategy definition grid when the strategy is submitted.</li>


		
				<li>Click the <b>Create</b> button dropdown arrow and select one of the following:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Create</b> &mdash; Creates and submits the strategy to the exchange.</li>
			<li><b>Watch</b> &mdash; Sends the strategy to the Watchlist widget in your workspace.</li>
		<li><b>Create & Watch</b> Submits the strategy to the exchange and sends it to the Watchlist widget in your workspace.</li>
	</ul>

<p><b>Tip</b>: You can also drag-and-drop the created strategy from the execution report panel to the Watchlist.</p>

	<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/trade-strategy-create.png" alt=""></p>
