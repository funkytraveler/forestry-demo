<p>A With A Tick (WAT) order is a limit order that that is automatically repriced one tick towards the market based on the price and quantity of the opposite inside market as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When best available price is more than one tick away from the limit price, the WAT order is repriced.</li>
  <li>If the best available price is one tick away and the available quantity drops below a specified threshold, the WAT order is repriced.</li>
</ul>
<p>The WAT threshold is a parameter set by the user in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Qty</strong>: The threshold is an absolute value.</li>
  <li><strong>%</strong>: The threshold is a percentage of the WAT order quantity.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, you could place a buy order and join the best bid with a WAT threshold of 100. When the best ask quantity drops below 100, the buy order price will be repriced one tick higher.</p>

<p>TT also allows you to add With A Tick behavior to all child orders of other TT Order Types, except for <a href="tto-trailing-limit-order.html">TT&nbsp;Trailing&nbsp;Limit</a><!-- and <a href="tto-retry-order.html"></a>-->.</p>

<p>A WAT order can be repriced immediately after placement in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If a WAT order is placed at the inside market when the bid/ask spread is greater than one tick, the order will immediately reprice by one tick.</li>
  <li>If a WAT order is placed off of the inside market, for example joining the second best bid or second best ask, the WAT order will immediately reprice by one tick.</li>
</ul>
