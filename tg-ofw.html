<p>The TT <a href="of-orders-and-fills-overview.html">Orders and Fills</a> widget helps you easily monitor and manage your working orders and fills. It combines the features and functionality of the <a href="ob-order-book-overview.html">Order Book</a>, <a href="fls-overview.html">Fills</a> and <a href="pos-positions-overview.html">Positions</a> widgets into a single widget.</p>

	<li>The <strong>Positions</strong> panel displays the positions for all fills displayed in the Fills panel, giving you a snapshot of the related positions and P/L.</li>

<h2 id="fill-recapper">Fill Recapper functionality in the Orders and Fills Window</h2>
<p>Fill Recapper is an add-on application to X_TRADER Pro that can be used to manage fills, perform post-trade allocations and export fills. In TT, the <a href="https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/help/x-trader/orders-and-fills-window/introduction-to-the-orders-and-fills/" target="_blank">Orders and Fills Window</a> implements much of the same functionality. Using the <strong>Orders</strong> and <strong>Fills</strong> panes, you can easily select a set of orders in the <strong>Orders</strong> pane and then view all of the individual fills, along with their respective price, quantity and side, that correspond to those orders in the <strong>Fills</strong> pane. <!--You can also select desired fills in the <strong>Fills</strong> pane and export them to a <strong>.csv</strong> file to view them in a spreadsheet application.--></p>

<ol>
    <li>Select the desired orders in the <strong>Orders</strong> pane.</li>
    <li><a href="wgt-resizing-column-widths.html">Configure</a> the <strong>Fills</strong> pane display to show only the specific columns, ordered as desired.</li>
    <li>Expand the aggregated fills to show the individual fills for the selected orders.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="fill-export">Sharing fills with clients</h2>
<p>The <a href="of-orders-and-fills-overview.html">Orders and Fills</a> widget also makes it easy for brokers to communicate order activity with their clients. Using the <strong>Fills</strong> pane, brokers can quickly confirm fills and use filters to display only unconfirmed fills. Brokers can also create fill summary reports that can be shared with clients. After filtering fills by the desired criteria, such as by instrument or account, specific fills can be exported to a <strong>.csv</strong> file and sent to a client to view the fills in a spreadsheet application.</p>
