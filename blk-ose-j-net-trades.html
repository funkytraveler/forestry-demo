<p>The TT&reg; platform supports <a href="https://www.jpx.co.jp/english/derivatives/rules/j-net/index.html">J-NET Trading on OSE</a>. Using the Blocktrader widget on TT, you can submit the following orders:
</p>

<ul>
 	<li>J-Net One Sided: Orders that are only posted to the
participant listed as the counterparty. J-Net One Sided
orders are only executed after the counterparty submits a matching
J-NET One Sided order.</li>

 	<li>J-Net Cross: Orders where the bid-side participant and
an ask-side participant are set within the same order message.
Both sides of the order are then executed as a Cross order.

<li>J-NET Combo: Orders with multiple options and futures instruments that can be executed at the same time, and where the bid-side participant and an ask-side participant are set within the same order message.
</li>
</ul>


<h2 class="SubSectionTitle">Matching a J-Net One Sided trade</h2>

<p class="">J-NET One Sided orders are only executed after both traders submit a matching J-NET
One Sided order. To match these trades, OSE requires the following:</p>

<ul>
 	<li>The orders must have the same trade type, instrument, price, and quantity.</li>
 	<li>Both sides of the trade (Buy and Sell) must be set.</li>
 	<li>Both participants must set each other as their counterparty.</li>
</ul>
