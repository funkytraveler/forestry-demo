		<p>Using the Spread Matrix and a floating order entry screen, you can quickly enter orders for all outrights and exchange-listed calendar, Butterfly and Condor spreads within a single window for active spread trading.</p>

		<p>When you click a market data cell for an instrument that does not intersect with another instrument in the matrix, a floating order entry widget opens pre-populated with the exchange's price for that instrument. When you click a market data cell where the products intersect in the matrix, a floating order entry widget opens pre-populated with the exchange's price for the calendar spread.</p>
