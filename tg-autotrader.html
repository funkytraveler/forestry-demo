<p hidden><a href="https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/help/autotrader/managing-autotrader/introduction-to-managing-autotrader" target="_blank">Autotrader</a> for X_TRADER lets you automate order submission and management based on Excel links
  or a set of formulas using trading parameters, theoretical pricing and current market conditions. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/help/autotrader/managing-autotrader/introduction-to-managing-autotrader" target="_blank">Autotrader</a> for X_TRADER is an automated
  order management tool that lets you execute complex strategies,
  quote markets, and scalp using a set of pre-defined formulas. You can provide formula values manually or use links
  from Excel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://library.tradingtechnologies.com/trade/aut-autotrader-overview.html">TT Autotrader widget</a>
  provides similar market-making capabilities through a set of TT-provided <a href="https://library.tradingtechnologies.com/trade/pa-public-algos.html">pubic algos</a>. TT Autotrader also lets
  you deploy, launch, and manage your own custom trading strategies implemented as <a href="https://library.tradingtechnologies.com/adl/index.html">ADL algos</a>. Using TT Autotrader, you can configure
  multiple instances of these algos, submitting orders based on the algo logic. Like Autotrader for X_TRADER, you can
  also link your Excel data directly into TT Autotrader.
  <!--TT Autotrader also supports co-location for algos, which lets you deploy and run your algos near a selected market instead of on your local X_TRADER workstation.-->

<p>TT Autotrader lets you:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://library.tradingtechnologies.com/trade/aut-launching-an-algo-in-autotrader.html">Launch multiple
      algo instances</a> and specify algo parameters in Autotrader or copy them from your Excel spreadsheets.</li>
  <li>Use <a href="https://library.tradingtechnologies.com/trade/xl-excel-linking-overview.html">Excel linking</a> to
    drive your trading strategies.</li>
  <li>Deploy and run your algos on specialized algo servers located near a selected market (co-location) instead of on
    your local X_TRADER workstation, which can significantly reduce latency.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="market-making">Market-making with TT public algos</h2>
<p>TT <a href="https://library.tradingtechnologies.com/trade/pa-public-algos.html">pubic algos</a> incorporate the features of the Autotrader for X_Trader parameters box into a set of automated order entry strategies that allow users to quote a market based on a set of input parameters. These public algos let you quickly and easily launch a variety of market-making strategies, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Direct Entry</li>
  <li>Single and Bid/Ask Theo</li>
  <li>Market Base</li>
  <li>Reference Market</li>
</ul>

<h2>Custom formulas</h2>
<!--
<p>The formulas available in 7.X Autotrader are not directly supported in the TT Autotrader widget. Instead you can add
  formulas to the algo logic in <a href="https://library.tradingtechnologies.com/adl/index.html">ADL</a>. Because the
  formulas are integrated with the algos that run in co-located Algo servers, they also benefit from a significant
  reduction in latency.</p>
-->
<p>In X_TRADER, users had the ability to create custom formulas directly in the Formula columns. In TT, users have two options to add custom formulas within the market making algorithm. Users looking for the most performant solution should include the custom formulas directly within the <a href="https://library.tradingtechnologies.com/adl/index.html">ADL</a> logic itself. This option would have all calculations performed on the Algo server within the co-located datacenter. For those users that are not familiar with ADL, they can use <a href="https://library.tradingtechnologies.com/trade/xl-excel-integration-with-tt-overview.html">RTD</a> to pull market/order data into Excel, perform the calculation within Excel and then link the output back to Autotrader.</p>
