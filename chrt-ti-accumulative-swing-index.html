---
<p>
The Accumulative Swing Index created by Welles Wilder attempts to find the swing line within the bar. Originally created to apply to daily bars, as there is a market or user defined value of the maximum price change that can occur during the trading session.  Using the study on intra-day bar data will require the user to specify a limit value for the given bar interval. 
</p>
<br>
Welles Wilder created this indicator based on the below important reference points: 
<ol>
<li>Today's close is higher (lower) than the prior close</li>
<li>Today's close is higher (lower) than today's open</li>
<li>Today's high (low) is greater (less) than the prior close</li>
<li>Today's low (high) is greater (less) than the prior close</li>
<li>The prior close was above (below) the prior open. </li>
</ol>

        <p>
        \[ASI_{t} = ASI_{t-1} + SI_{t}\]
        </p>
        where
        <br>
        <p>\(SI_{t}\) is the current bar's swing index calculated by the formula:</p>
        <p>\[SI_{t} = 50 \times \left ( \frac{Close_{t} - Close_{t-1}+0.5\times(Close_{t}-Open_{t})+0.25 \times (Close_{t-1}-Open_{t-1})}{R} \right ) \times \frac{K}{T}\]</p>
        <p>where</p>
        <p>\[K = max\left ( High_{t} - Close_{t-1}\;,\;Close_{t-1} - Low_{t} \right )\]</p>
        <p>\(T\) is a user defined value which means the maximum price change during a trading session.</p>
        <p>\(R\) is a value calculated on the base of the relationship between current close price and previous high and low prices. The formula is:</p>
        <p>\[R = TR - 0.5 \times ER + 0.25 \times SH\]</p>
        <p>where</p>
        <p>\[TR = max(High_{t} - Close_{t-1} , Close_{t-1} - Low_{t} , High_{t} - Low_{t})\]</p>
        <p>\[ER = \left\{\begin{matrix} High_{t} - Close_{t-1} & if Close_{t-1} >  High_{t} \\ 0 & if Low_{t} \leq  Close_{t-1} \leq High_{t}   \\ Close_{t-1} - Low_{t} & if Close_{t-1} < Low_{t} \end{matrix}\right.\]</p>
        <p>\[SH = Close_{t-1} - Open_{t-1}\]</p>
