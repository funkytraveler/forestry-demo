  <h2 id="linked-widget">Linked widgets</h2>

  <p>From a Market Grid, you can quickly launch a linked MD Trader or Order Ticket. The linked widget can be identified by a yellow border. The linked widget remains open unless you close it, and you can quickly switch instruments in the linked widget by clicking on any instrument in the Market Grid. This allow you to trade one instrument and then quickly trade a different 
    instrument.</p>

<div>
  <h2 id="group">Widget Groups</h2>
  <p>You can create a widget group with the Market Grid and an order entry widget to trade with both as a single widget. As you submit orders for an instrument using the order entry widget, you can view the market in the Market Grid. As you change instruments in the Market Grid, they automatically appear in the order entry widget in the group.</p>

<div>
  <h2>Number of Orders (Headcount)</h2>
<p>The Market Grid provides optional columns that show the number of orders (i.e., headcount) that comprises the total bid and ask quantity at each price in the market. By viewing the number of orders, you can gain insight to the makeup of the bid or ask quantity displayed at that price level.</p>

<p>Some exchanges provide the number of orders in their market data feeds. If an exchange does not provide this data, TT calculates the number of orders based on the detailed depth provided by the exchange. If an exchange provides neither the number of orders or detailed depth, the optional columns for displaying the number of orders in the Market Grid will be blank.</p>


<h3>Number of orders display</h3>

 <p>The number of orders at a price level for bids and asks are displayed in the optional <b>BidCnt</b> and <b>AskCnt</b> columns. These columns are shown using the <b>Set Market Grid columns</b> option in the <a href="mg-reference.html">Market Grid widget settings</a>.</p>
