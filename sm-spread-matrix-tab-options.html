   <h4>Autospreader tab</h4>

   <p>You can use Spread Matrix to display market data for multiple instruments of two different products and all of the associated spreads between those instruments. You can use the 
    <b>Autospreader</b> tab to use previously defined two-legged, Autospreader® spreads to populate a Spread Matrix, or you can use the Custom tab if the desired synthetic spread does not already 
    exist.</p>

    
    <p><b>Note</b>: The <b>Autospreader</b> tab only displays synthetic inter-product spreads. If there are no inter-product spreads created in Autospreader®, this dropdown will be empty.</p>

   <h4>Custom tab</h4>

   <p>To populate a Spread Matrix with two different products when there is not an existing Autospreader spread comprised of legs of the two different products, click the <b>Custom</b> tab. This tab provides basic Autospreader® functionality for configuring a two-legged, synthetic inter-product spread.</p>
