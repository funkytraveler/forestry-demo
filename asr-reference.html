              <td>Delta</td>
              <td>
                Upon receiving a fill for a given leg, Autospreader calculates Delta as the number of contracts that the leg is off from being perfectly hedged when compared to another leg. The Delta of a given leg can be calculated only when compared to another single leg, and is continuously recalculated by the Autospreader as long as the spread legs are working in the market.
                <!-- <p>For example, consider a 3 x 5 spread with 2 fills in the front leg and 4 fills in the back leg. Delta for the front leg in comparison to the back leg is: 4 back leg fills * 3/5 ratio - 2 front leg fills = 0.4 (debit). Delta for the back leg in comparison to the front leg is: 2 front leg fills * 3/5 spread ratio - 4 back leg fills = 0.67 (credit).</p>
                <p>So, in order to "balance" the legs (i.e., achieve the perfect 3 x 5 spread ratio), the Autospreader Strategy Engine has to either subtract the 0.4 delta (front leg debit) or add the 0.67 delta (back leg credit) when calculating hedge and quote order quantities. To place a quote order in this example, the Autospreader Strategy Engine will walk the depth in the back leg market and add the back leg delta in order to calculate the quote order quantity in the front leg. If there are 7 contracts to lean on in the back leg market, the Autospreader Strategy Engine will produce the CalculatedQuoteOrderQuantity as (7 contracts + 0.67 back leg credit) * 3/5 spread ratio = 4.6. After rounding up, the Autospreader Strategy Engine will place a quote order for 5 contracts.</p> -->
