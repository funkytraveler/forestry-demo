    <h3>Routable Accounts</h3>
    <p><!--Click the <strong>Accounts</strong> tab to view your routable accounts. -->Accounts are downloaded from the Setup database, and the account and exchange data displayed in Preferences is read-only. Accounts assigned to you are displayed in this section if they are configured as "Routable" in the Setup app. Any accounts configured as "Non-Routing" are not displayed.</p>
    
    
    <p>Using a pair of radio buttons in the <strong>Routable Accounts</strong> section, you can select one of following viewing options:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Exchange</strong></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p></p>
    
    <p>When the <strong>Account</strong> view is selected, a table is displayed with accounts in the first column, and exchange connections that each account is assigned to shown in the third column. User-defined account aliases are shown in the second column when viewing by account. The Account view is displayed by default.</p>
    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/wrk-preferences-account-view2.png" alt=""></p>
    
    
    <p>When the <strong>Exchange</strong> view is selected, a table is displayed with exchange connections assigned to accounts in the fist column, and a listing of each account assigned to the exchange connections in the second column. User-defined account aliases are shown in the third column when viewing by exchange. In both views, the column widths can be adjusted.</p>
    
    
    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/wrk-preferences-exchange-view2.png" alt=""></p>
    
    <!-- <p><strong>Note</strong>: The Exchange view does not display the <strong>Alias</strong> column, because the alias names are set per account and there may be multiple accounts on a single exchange row.</p>
    <p>To edit a routable account alias...</p> -->
    
    <p>Use the <strong>Alias</strong> column in both views to enter an alias name for identifying an account. When the account list is displayed in order entry widgets, the alias name is prepended to the actual
    account name in parentheses. To add or modify an alias, double-click a cell in the <strong>Alias</strong> column and enter an alias name.</p>
