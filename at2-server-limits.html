<p>Based on which data center executes your ADL algos, the number of ADL algos you can run simultaneously is limited as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Aurora: at least 100 but possibly as many as 400 depending upon system load
	</li>
	<li>
		Bangkok: 100
	</li>
	<li>
		All other co-location facilities: at least 100 but possibly as many as 200 depending upon system load
	</li>
</ul>

<p>These limits do not apply to Algo Servers deployed on TT Reserved instances. If you have any questions or are interested in a dedicated Algo Server deployed on a TT Reserved instance, please contact your TT Customer Success representative.</p>
