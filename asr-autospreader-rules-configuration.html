  <p>The fields at the top of the interface are for entering a rule name and description, and defining a rule type.</p> 
      <h3>Rule name and description</h3>
      <p>Use these fields to enter a name for your rule and to enter a brief description. The rule name appears in the AutospreaderÂ® Rules widget's list of rules.</p>
  
      <h3 id="rule-type">Rule Type</h3>
      <p>After entering a name and brief description for your rule, select a rule type. 
      </p>
      <p>The specific actions (or "rules") for each leg fall under three basic rule types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Quoting Order</b> &mdash; Allows you to determine how (and if) quote orders are placed by the Autospreader Server.</li>
        <li>
        <b>Pre-Hedge Order</b> &mdash; Allows you to modify or cancel hedge orders before they are sent to the exchange.</li>
        <li>
        <b>Post-Hedge Order</b> &mdash; Allows you to modify hedge orders after they are sent to the exchange.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>After selecting the rule type, use the Autospreader Rules configuration interface to define condition types, conditions, and actions using the <b>Logic</b> tab. You can also create your own variables to use when defining conditions and actions using the <b>Custom Variable</b> tab.</p>
