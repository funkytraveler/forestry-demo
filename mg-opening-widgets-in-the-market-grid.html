  <ul>
 
    <li>a stand-alone widget</li>
    <li>a linked widget</li>
  </ul>

<div>
  <h2 id="launch-independent">Using a stand-alone widget</h2>
   <!-- emphasis is show how to open one. use a chart in this example. list all the linked widget options. use ot or mdt for "trading" topic -->
        <p>A stand-alone widget is populated with market data for an instrument selected in the Market Grid.</p> 
        	<p>To use a stand-alone widget:</p>

            <li>
                <p>Right-click on an instrument row and select <b>Open</b> to show a list of widgets that can be opened from the Market Grid.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Click on a widget (e.g., Chart) to select it.</p>
                <p>The widget opens and is seeded with market data for the selected instrument.</p>

            </li>
        </ol>

<div>
  <h2 id="launch-linked">Using a linked widget</h2>
    <!-- emphasis is show how to open one. use a chart in this example. list all the linked widget options. use ot or mdt for "trading" topic -->
        <p>A linked widget is populated with market data for a selected instrument, but updates automatically when you select other instruments in the Market Grid.</p>

        <p>To use a linked widget:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Right-click on an instrument row and select <b>Launch linked...</b> to show a list of widgets that can be linked to the Market Grid.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Click on a widget (e.g., Time & Sales) to select it.</p>
                <p>The linked widget opens with a yellow border.</p>
                <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/mg-linked-widget-2.png"></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the Market Grid, click a different instrument (e.g., CL Feb17) to select it.</p>
                <p>The linked widget (e.g., Time & Sales) now contains the market data for the selected instrument.</p>
                <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/mg-linked-widget-3.png"></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
