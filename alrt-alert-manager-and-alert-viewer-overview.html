		<p>You can open an <b>Alert Detail</b> screen from Alert Manager to <a href="alrt-creating-an-alert.html">create an alert</a>. After the alert is created, it appears in the Alert Manager, which allows you to copy, edit, delete, pause, and run the alert. The Alert Manager also shows you the alert name, description, color, and alert status.</p>

		<p>To open the Alert Manager, click <b>Widgets</b> | <b>Miscellaneous</b> | <b>Alert Manager</b> in the workspace menu bar.</p>
