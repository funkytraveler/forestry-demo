<p>Using the Strategy Creation widget, you can create all <a href="https://www.asx.com.au/documents/products/asx-user-defined-combinations.pdf">User Defined Combinations (UDCs) supported on the ASX NTP platform</a>. You can create and publish both fixed leg and net price strategies, as well as send an RFQ or trade these strategies directly from the widget.</p>

<p>The default price for a futures-only or options-only UDC is net price, but you can also set a fixed price for  one of the strategy legs:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>For a futures delta strategy, only the futures leg can have a fixed price and not the 
			options leg.</li>
		<li>For an all options strategy, only one of the legs can have a fixed price.</li>
	</ul>

<p>To enter a fixed price for a UDC in Strategy Creation, double-click the <b>Price</b> column field for the futures or options leg.</p>

	<p><b>Note</b>: If two UDC strategies are created with the same instruments, they will be published and 
		listed as separate strategies at the exchange if one of the UDCs includes a fixed price leg.</p>
