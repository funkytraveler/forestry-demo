<p>You can use the Order Upload feature to submit orders into the TT platform using a comma-separated (<strong>.csv</strong>) file.</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/ob-upload-orders-intro.png" alt=""/></p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Before uploading orders, the .csv files must be properly formatted. The <a href="ob-upload-csv-file.html">Order upload .csv file format</a> help describes the format of the order upload file and the supported order parameters.</p>

<p>Additionally, you must be authorized in Setup to trade with all accounts provided in the upload file.</p>

<h2>Uploading an orders file</h2>
<p>To upload orders from a orders <strong>.csv</strong> file:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		In the Order Book, select <strong>Upload orders</strong> from the context menu.
		<p></p>
		The <strong>Upload Orders</strong> dialog appears.
		<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/ob-upload-orders-dialog.png" alt=""/></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		In the <strong>Upload Orders</strong> dialog, either <strong>Select files</strong> to locate the desired <strong>.csv</strong> files or drag them to the dialog; then click <strong>Close</strong>.
		<p></p>
		The <strong>Order Book Import</strong> Column Mapper appears. It shows the columns that could be automatically mapped from your input file, along with columns that either could not be mapped automatically or have no values for one or more of the orders.
		<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/ob-upload-col-mapper-dialog.png" alt=""/></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Map the <strong>Unused Columns</strong> to their corresponding <strong>Import Load Columns</strong> either by dragging an unused column to its corresponding import column or by clicking or by clicking a blank column and selecting the desired column from the drop-down list.

		<p></p>
		The <strong>IMPORT PREVIEW</strong> panel presents a preview of the information for the orders defined in the uploaded <strong>.csv</strong> files. The panel displays only the first ten orders; all of the orders are imported, however.
	</li>
	<li>
		When you have finished mapping the columns, click <strong>Confirm</strong>.
		<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/ob-upload-orders-grid.png" alt=""/></p>
		<p></p>
		<strong>Note</strong>: You do not have to map all columns. Data for unmapped columns will be ignored during the import.
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Submitting uploaded orders</h2>
<p>To submit the uploaded orders:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		For each order, verify the order parameters.
	</li>
	<li>
		If you need to update an order parameter, such as changing a price that is no longer valid or changing the order TIF, you can click in the field and change the value.
		<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/ob-upload-orders-modify.png" alt=""/></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Do one or both of the following:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Select all orders you want to submit directly to the exchange, and click <strong>Submit to Exchange</strong>.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you want to submit orders into the TT system, but not yet to the exchanges, select the desired orders and click <strong>Submit as Held</strong>.
				<p></p>
				<strong>Note</strong>: TT Order Type orders (i.e. TT Stop, TT Iceberg, etc.) cannot be submitted as held orders; they will go directly to Working state.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p></p>
		After the orders are submitted, they are deactivated in the Order Upload preview widget. 
		<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/ob-upload-orders-submit-error.png" alt=""/></p>
		<p></p>
		To give you visual cues for orders successfully submitted:
		<ul>
		  <li>The row text is changed to italics.</li>
		  <li>The check box is removed.</li>
		  <li>A yellow gear icon is displayed in the row for orders submitted as Held; a green check mark is displayed for orders that were successfully submitted to the exchange.</li>
		</ul>
		<p></p>
		If an error occurs when submitting an order, a red triangle indicates the order needs correction.
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Correcting errors in uploaded orders</h2>
<p>If the uploaded file contains errors, such as missing or invalid values, the corresponding order rows are disabled and problematic order parameter values are highlighted.</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/ob-upload-orders-error-intro.png" alt=""/></p>
<ol>
    <li>Error indicator icon</li>
    <li>Order parameters that need correction</li>
</ol>
<p>To correct errors:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
    	Hover over the error icon to display the errors related to an order. 
    	<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/ob-upload-orders-error-message.png" alt=""/></p>
    </li>
    <li>
    	In each of the highlighted fields for the order, click in the cell and correct the value.
    	<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/ob-upload-orders-error-correction.png" alt=""/></p>
    	<p></p>
    	<strong>Note</strong>: When you correct all errors for an order, the error icon is removed and the check box is enabled so you can submit the order.
    	<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/ob-upload-orders-error-fixed.png" alt=""/></p>
    </li>
    <li>
    	When the errors are corrected, submit the orders by clicking <strong>Submit as Held</strong> or <strong>Submit to Exchange</strong>.
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>A special note about the Contract field</h3>
<p>In row 8 of the the previous example, the <strong>Contract</strong> field for the order (<strong>ZB Dec18</strong>) is highlighted as an error with error message "Contract: Missing instrument data", even though the contract name looks correct. This error commonly occurs when using the wrong contract name.  In this case, the .csv file contained the following entry for the last order.</p>
<pre>S, 10, CME, ZB Dec18, 151'14, Day, Limit, , , 12345,,</pre>
<p>As described in the <a href="ob-upload-csv-file.html">Order upload .csv file format</a> help, all contracts must be specified using the exhange-provided "short" contract name, which is listed in the Instrument Data dialog (<strong>Type Shift-Ctrl-X</strong> in MD Trader or Market Grid row).</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/ob-upload-orders-instr-data.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>Because the order entry in the .csv file identified the contract by specifying "ZB Dec18" instead of "ZBZ8", the upload identified the contract name as an error.</p>
