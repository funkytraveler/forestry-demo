  <h3>Creating a strategy in the Options Chain</h3>
  <p>From the Options Chain, you can create a synthetic options spread as a user-defined strategy in the Strategy Creation widget. These spreads can be published to the market by the exchange and made available from trading in the current trading session.</p>
  <p>To create a strategy in the Options Chain:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Press and hold the <b>Ctrl</b> key (<b>control</b> or <b>command</b> key for Mac OS) to enter spread building mode.</p>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/options-chain-spread-building-mode.png"></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Click a Bid price to add for the desired options contract to add a buy leg to the strategy, or click an Ask price to add a sell leg to the strategy.</p>
      <p>Multiple clicks on a bid/ask contract increments the ratio/quantity of that leg of the strategy.</p>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/options-chain-spread-builder-legs.png"></p>
      <p><b>Note</b>: If you left-click or right-click on a price in the <b>Strike</b> column, the legs for a straddle strategy are automatically selected.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Release the <b>Ctrl</b> key.</p>
      <p>The Strategy Creation widget opens seeded with the options contracts, ratio, and buy/sell direction for each options leg. <!--The strategy is also seeded with one futures leg:  If all options have the same expiry, the underlying futures contract is seeded as the futures leg. If the option spread is a calendar spread, the underlying futures contract of the farthest option contract expiry is seeded as the futures leg. Check the <b>Fix</b> checkbox to cover your position in the options with a position in the underlying futures contract. --></p>
