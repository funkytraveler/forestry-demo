In the Alerts Manager widget, select an alert and can click <img src="Content/alrt-pause-button.png"> to pause it. When an alert is paused, it will not be triggered and appear in the Alerts Viewer.

		<p>To resume sending the alert, 
	click <img src="Content/alrt-play-button.png">. When you resume running an alert, it can be triggered and appear in the Alerts Viewer. Pop-up notifications to the desktop and push notifications to TT Mobile also resume running if they are enabled. The <b>Status</b> column shows "Running" when the alert is active.</p>
