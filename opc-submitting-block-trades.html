    <p>From the Options Chain, you can build complex options spreads and strategies to enter as blocks in the Blocktrader widget. These block trades can be configured and reported to the exchange using Blocktrader.</p>
   
  <p>The Options Chain provides quick access to the following commonly-used strategies as well as a custom feature to define your own strategies.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Strip</b>: Series of same-side orders for a range of consecutive months</li>
      <li><b>Calendar</b>: Two opposite-side orders for different months</li>
      <li><b>Combo</b>: Orders for both call and put options for the same strike price</li>
      <li><b>Combo &Delta;0</b>: Covered combo in which the options are hedged by the underlying instrument with a neutral delta</li>
      <li><b>Custom</b>: User-defined combination of legs, quantities, and ratios</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you select one of the strategies, the Options Chain automatically ensures that the strategy contains the proper relationship, quantities, and ratios for the strategy legs before it is sent to Blocktrader.</p>
