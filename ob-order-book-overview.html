  <h2>Sorting</h2>
  <p>By default, the Order Book displays working orders in reverse chronological order based on the time each order was submitted, with the most recent orders appearing at the top. You can change the sort order by clicking the name of a column once for normal order and twice for reverse order (a third click removes the column from the sort). If you want to display the orders so that all the buy orders are shown first, followed by the sell orders, you would click the <strong>B/S</strong> column heading.</p>

  <p id="multi-sort">You can also sort the orders hierarchically using multiple columns by clicking the column headings in the order you want to sort while holding down the Shift key. The following example sorts the orders in the Order Book first by the <strong>Account</strong> column, then by the <strong>Contract</strong> column, and finally by the <strong>B/S</strong> column (reverse order).</p>
