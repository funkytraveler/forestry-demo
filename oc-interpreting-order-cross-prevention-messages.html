	<h3 id="pt-msg">Interpreting order cross prevention messages</h3>

	<p>Order cross prevention messages appear in the Audit Trail and Fills widgets. Different messages are displayed based on the order cross prevention rule applied to your account.</p> 


	<h3>Position Transfer messages</h3>

	<p>When the Position Transfer rule is applied to your account, orders submitted with any account in the account tree (on the branch at which Order Cross Prevention is set) are matched internally by the TT system, and Position Transfer messages are displayed in the Audit Trail and Fills widgets in the Trade application.</p>

<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>For example, a 100 lot buy is resting at the exchange, and a 100 lot sell is submitted using the same account, which is configured with the Order Cross Prevention rule of “Position Transfer”. Based on the Position Transfer rule, the 100 lot buy and sell orders are matched internally at the resting order's Limit price and the original 100 lot buy is canceled at the exchange by the TT system. In the following Audit Trail, the <b>Message</b> column displays "Position Transfer" and the <b>FillQty</b> column shows the fully filled order quantity. Also, the message <i>Reduced resting order &lt;Exchange Order ID&gt; for PosXfer</i> is displayed to show the original order is canceled due to internal, pre-exchange matching for a full fill.<p>

        </p>

<p>
In the Fills widget for this example, the two internally matched Fills appear for the 100 lot buy and sell cross orders. The <b>Route</b> column shows "Internal," indicating the TT system canceled the working order and created fills for the 100 lot buy and sell orders to prevent order crossing at the exchange. </p>

<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>In this example, a 100 lot buy order is resting at the exchange, and a 75 lot sell is submitted using the same account. Order Cross Prevention is set to Position Transfer for the account, so the 100 lot buy and 75 lot sell are matched internally at the resting order's Limit price. The 100 lot buy is partially filled for 75 contracts and the original quantity is replaced at the exchange with a new quantity of 25.  In the following Audit Trail, the <b>Message</b> column displays "Position Transfer" to show the internally matched 75 lot sell and partially filled 100 lot buy with a new working quantity of 25, and the message <i>Reduced resting order &lt;Exchange Order ID&gt; for PosXfer</i> is displayed to show the original order quantity is replaced due to internal, pre-exchange matching for a partial fill.</p>

<p>
In the Fills widget for this example, the two internally matched fills are logged: the 75 lot sell and the 100 lot buy partially filled for 75 contracts. The <b>Route</b> column shows "Internal," indicating the TT system replaced the original order and created a partial fill for the 100 lot buy and a full fill for the 75 lot sell orders to prevent order crossing at the exchange. </p>

<h3>Cancel Resting (wait for ack) messages</h3>

<p>When the Cancel Resting (wait for ack) order cross prevention rule is applied, the <i>Canceled resting orders &lt;Exchange Order ID&gt; to avoid crossing orders</i> message appears in the Audit Trail to indicate that the resting order has been canceled and that the new, potentially crossing order in the same account has been submitted. The new order is submitted after TT receives the cancel acknowledgement from the exchange:</p>

        </p>

<p></p>
<h3>Reject New messages</h3>

<p>When the Reject New order cross prevention rule is applied, the new order that can cross with the resting order is immediately rejected and the original order remains working at the exchange:</p>
