   <p>You can submit an aggregated instrument order the same way you submit an order for an exchange-traded instrument. For an aggregated instrument, you can submit an order in the <a href="mdt-entering-orders-in-mdtrader.html">MD Trader</a> widget or <a href="mg-trading-from-the-market-grid.html">Market Grid</a> widget.</p>

   <p>An order for a synthentic Aggregator instrument can be submitted as a native Limit order or TT Iceberg order, which allows you to execute the total quantity of your order in smaller, disclosed portions.</p>

   <h2>Submit an aggregated instrument order using MD Trader</h2>

 <p>Click in the aggregated quantity column at a price level to buy or sell the aggregated instrument. Aggregator uses the
 parameters you set in the Aggregator
 Configuration dialog box to determine the prices at which
 the legs are traded. If you launched the aggregated instrument by selecting <b>Open MD Trader with Legs</b>, working orders appear in the MD Trader widgets for each leg. </p>

  <p>Whenever you trade
 an aggregated instrument, all working orders in the Aggregator leg panes have
 a vertical color bar on the left side in the <b>Work</b> column.
 This color bar designates a working Aggregator order and uses the leg color you assigned
 to the aggregated instrument in the Aggregator Configuration dialog box.</p>

  <p><b>Note</b>: If the individual legs of an aggregated instrument are displayed in MD Trader, you can enter an order for any of the legs by clicking in the <b>Bid</b> or <b>Ask</b> quantity column for the specific leg at the desired price level. Orders entered directly into the leg markets will not display the color bar.</p>

<p>The following image shows an Aggregator MD Trader opened with separate MD Trader widgets for each leg market that comprises the aggregated instrument:</p>

  <h2>Submit an aggregated instrument order using the Market Grid</h2>

<p>To view market data and enter orders for your aggregated instruments using the Market Grid widget, click launch or drag and drop your aggregated instrument from
 the Aggregator Manager window into the Market Window. You can enter an order for the aggregated instrument the same as for exchange-defined instruments: Click a price to open a floating order entry widget, select an order type or account as needed, and submit your order.</p>



<p>When entering orders for aggregated instruments in the Market Grid, consider the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The market depth functionality in the Depth column in the Market
 Grid is also enabled for rows containing Aggregator instruments.</li>

<li>Selecting MD Trader from the Market Grid context menu will only
 launch the MD Trader for the Aggregator instrument and not the legs.
 To launch the instrument and leg orders, use the Aggregator Manager
 window.</li>

<li>Context menu options are enabled, including the ability to launch MD Trader, Order Ticket, and 
    Time and Sales.</li>


</ul>

<p>Aggregator uses the
 parameters you set in the Aggregator
 Configuration dialog box to determine the prices at which
 the legs are traded. Working orders appear for the aggregated instrument and each leg in the 
 Market Grid:</p>

<!--price offset: use case likely for viewing similar products side-by-side in the price ladder by using the offset to show the same price. Aggregator applies the configured offset before entering the orders at the desired price. -->


 <h2 id="account">Submitting an Aggregator order using multiple accounts</h2>

<p>The Aggregator MD Trader provides you with the ability to select separate accounts for routing the child orders of a parent aggregator order. For example, you can use separate accounts on different exchanges to submit orders, or split trading between separate accounts and different brokers.</p>

<p>When you launch an aggregated instrument, the legs are seeded automatically based on any order default <a href="https://library.tradingtechnologies.com/trade/win-reference.html#account-settings">account settings</a> you may have configured. The default accounts may also be different per leg.</p>


<p>To submit an Aggregator order using multiple accounts:</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Click the account selector in the Aggregator MD Trader and select <b>Multi...</b>.</p>
    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/aggregator-multi-account1.png"></p>
  </li>

  <li><p>In the flyout panel that appears, click the account selector for each leg and select an account.</p>


  <p>Your default account displayed in <b>All Legs</b> is used for routing the leg orders. </p>
    <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/aggregator-multi-account2.png"></p>

    <p>When you select a different account for each leg, then <b>Multi...</b> appears in <b>All Legs</b> and each separate account is displayed for <b>Leg 1</b> and <b>Leg 2</b>, etc.</p>

      <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/aggregator-multi-account2a.png"></p>

  <Li><p>Configure and submit the aggregator order in the Aggregator MD Trader.</p>

    <p>After submitting the order, the flyout panel closes and the orders are submitted into the market. The leg orders are routed using the different accounts you selected.</p>
    <!-- <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/autospreader-multi-account3.png"></p> -->

    <p>If you hover on the account selector in the Aggregator MD Trader, a tooltip appears and displays your account selections for each leg.</p>

  </li>
</ol>




          <h2>Deleting parent Aggregator orders</h2>

          <p>Using the Floating Order Book, you can delete a parent Aggregator order and leave the child order(s) working in the market. For more details, refer to <a href="fob-deleting-parent-orders-in-the-floating-order-book.html">Deleting parent orders in the Floating Order Book</a>.</p>
