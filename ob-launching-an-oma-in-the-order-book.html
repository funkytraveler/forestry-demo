    <p>If you have access to an Order Management Algo (OMA), you can launch it for an order from the Order Book. To launch an algo for an existing order:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Select the desired order.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>Click <img src="Content/btn-launch-oma-algo.png" alt="">, and select the OMA algo to run.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Enter the information required by the algo, and click <img src="Content/btn-green-select-algo.png" alt="Launch Algo">.</p>

<h2 id="multiple-oma">Linking two orders using the OCO Order Management Algo</h2>
<p>TT provides you with the ability to select two working orders in the Order Book, and apply an OCO (Order Cancels Order) Order Management Algo (OMA). This allows you to select which child orders you want working in the market as part of an OCO.</p>

<!--
<p>TT released the OCO public algo that provides you with the ability to select two working orders in the Order Book and apply an OCO (Order Cancels Order) OMA algo to them. This public algo enhances the TT OCO order type to work with existing orders without regard to whether they use different products and quantities. You could, for example, apply an OCO OMA algo using a working order for a 5-lot BRN Dec17 instrument and an order for a 10-lot CL Dec17 order. The OCO public algo also lets you choose whether cancel the order if the market state of one of the child orders changes.</p>
<p>In addition to the <a href="tto-oco-order.html">TT OCO</a> order type parameters, the OCO public algo adds the following parameters:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Delete orphan</strong>: Whether to delete the balance of a larger order when an order with a smaller quantity is fully-filled.
      <br><br>
      If, at any time, the working quantity of either of the OCO OMA child orders goes to zero, the other order is considered to be an "orphan." When this parameter is TRUE, the remaining order is deleted, regardless of its working quantity.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Enforce Mkt State</strong>: Whether to delete the OCO order, and its child orders, if the market state of one of the child instruments changes to a state other than Open.
      <br><br>
      If the market state of an instrument changes to something other than Open, the algo sets a 250ms grace period timer. If, after the grace period, the market state is still not Open and Enforce Mkt State is enabled, both orders will be deleted. After sending the delete requests, the algo waits another 250ms and then terminates the algo.
    </li>
</ol>
-->
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The following types of orders cannot be converted to OCOs:</p>
<ul>
<li>TT Order Type parent orders</li>
<li>Autospreader&reg; parent orders</li>
<li>Aggregator parent orders</li>
<li>OTC orders</li>
</ul>


<p>To link two orders as an OCO:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select two orders in the Order Book.</li>
  </li>
  <li>
        <p>Click <img src="Content/btn-launch-oma-algo.png" alt="">, and select the <strong>OCO</strong> algo from the <strong>Shared with me</strong>.</p>

        <p hidden><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/ob-launch-oco-oma-new.png"></p>

      </li>
      <li>Ensure there are TT Order IDs for both working orders in the <strong>TTOrderKey</strong> fields and enter the other algo parameters as needed (e.g., Co-location).

      </li>

      <li>Click <img src="Content/btn-green-select-algo.png" alt="Launch Algo">.

        <p></p>
        The parent OCO order appears in the Order Book with "OCO" displayed in the <strong>Contract</strong> column and <strong>AlgoName</strong> column. The related child orders have the same OMA order ID displayed in the <strong>OMAOrderID</strong> column.
