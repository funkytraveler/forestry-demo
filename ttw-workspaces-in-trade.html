  <p>Workspaces consist of a single window or collection of windows which can be toggled between using keyboard shortcuts or by using the drop down menu located in the top menu bar. Each window of a workspace can be populated with its own combination of widgets.</p>



</div>



<div id="multiple-windows">

  <p>Each workspace begins with a single default window, named <b>Main</b>, but you can create additional windows within a workspace for more working area or to use separate windows for distinct purposes.</p>

  <p> Each window is viewed individually within the workspace, and you can easily switch between the windows. You can use multiple windows within a workspace to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create separate windows for different markets</li>
    <li>Add individual windows for trading related products (treasuries, energies, grains, etc.)</li>
    <li>Dedicate windows to trading for specific accounts</li>
   
    <li>Increase the effective area of a workspace so you are not constrained to the size of your physical display.</li>
  </ul>

<!-- Add wording for sending widgets to other windows (DOC-1503) --> 
<p>You can also also <a href="ttw-managing-multiwindow-workspaces-in-trade.html#send-widget">send widgets</a> from one window to another.</p>
