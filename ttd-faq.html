    <li>
    	<strong>By default, TT Desktop installs to path: <strong>C:\Program Files\Trading Technologies\</strong>. Can it be moved to a different location?</strong>
    	<p></p>
    	Yes. You can select a different default folder location while running the default installer. 
    </li>
    <li>
    	<strong>Can TT Desktop be delivered via SCCM?</strong>
    	<p></p>
    	Yes. The default TTD executable file can be made into a Microsoft SCCM package to help manage deployments across multiple workstations. However, this method will not provide version control for the application. 
    </li>
    <li><strong>What updates do I need to manage for TT Desktop?</strong>
        <p></p>
        TT Desktop is a local executable that connects to the services of the TT platform. This executable may require occasional updates. The TT platform services do not reside on the users machine so TT Desktop is always accessing the most recent version of the TT platform.
    </li>
    <li>
    	<strong>When TT Desktop is launched, will it attempt to download any updates?  Where will those updates be stored?</strong>
    	<p></p>
    	Yes. By default, the latest version of the TT Desktop application is always downloaded when a user logs in. The application code is held in memory during the session, and is discarded when TT Desktop is closed or refreshed.
    </li>
    <li>
       <strong> Can I control the auto-update of the TT Desktop application?</strong>
        <p></p>
        Yes. You can control the auto-update of the TT Desktop application by modifying the following Windows registry settings:
        <ul>
            <li>To disable auto-update for all users on the system, set the following registry key: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Trading Technologies\TT\WinSparkle\CheckForUpdates` = 0</li>
            <li>To disable automatic updates for the current user, set the following registry key: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Trading Technologies\TT\WinSparkle\CheckForUpdates` = 0</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    	<strong>Does the installation require an Internet connection?</strong>
    	<p></p>
    	Yes. An Internet connection is required for the download of the TT Desktop installer but is not required to run the installation.
    </li>
    <li>
    	<strong>Can I get a static version of TT software?</strong>
