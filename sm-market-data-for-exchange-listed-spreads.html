<p>Using the <b>Exchange Listed</b> tab when opening the Spread Matrix, you can display market data for an exchange-listed calendar 
	spread.</p>



<p>Right-click in the market data cells for a spread to view the context menu for the calendar spread. You can also right-click a single contract to open the context menu for the contract. In the context menu, select <b>Open...</b> to open an MD Trader, Order Ticket, Chart, or Time and Sales widget that displays the market data for the selected spread or outright contract.</p>

<h2>Market data display in Spread Matrix</h2>

        

        <p>Spread Matrix displays four pieces of market data for each outright contract or spread. The information is displayed in one of four cells that make up a larger grouping. The Spread Matrix displays Ask Price, Ask Quantity, Bid Price, and Bid Quantity.</p>

  <p>The Spread Matrix calculates implied prices instead of using the exchange implieds, and displays the calculated implied data even when it is not at the best price. To help visualize the implied quantities, you can enable the <strong>Show implieds with an asterisk (*)</strong> widget <a href="sm-reference.html">setting</a>, which will display an asterisk next to quantities that are partially or completely implied. Implied functionality varies by exchange, which determines how the implied prices function in TT. <!-- By default, the Spread Matrix color-codes implied prices and quantities. --></p>

       <p>To display prices above quantities for each outright or spread, enable (check) the <b>Show prices above quantities</b> option in <b>Settings: Spread Matrix.</p>
