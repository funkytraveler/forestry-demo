    <p>You can sort the list of orders based on the values in the Floating Order Book columns. To change the sorting order in the Floating Order Book, left-click the desired column to toggle between increasing and decreasing values.</p>


    <p><b>Note</b>: By default, the orders are sorted in descending order in the <b>Time</b> column.</p>

 
    <h2>Sorting orders based on users who share an order book</h2>
    
    <p>If you share an order book with other traders, you can use the <b>CurrentUser</b> column to see who last updated each order in the floating order book. You can sort on the column to group the orders by user.</p>

     <!--   <p><b>Tip</b>: You can also sort orders based on account when the "Filter" box is unchecked in MD Trader.</p> -->

  

  <h2>Sorting multiple columns in the Floating Order Book</h2>

  <p>Hold down the Shift key while clicking additional column headers to also sort those columns. Custom column sorts are also saved and restored once applied.</p>
