<h2>Contextual search</h2>

<p>TT allows you to enter a contextual search based on your input. For example, if you enter "CME" as an exchange name and "Spread" as a product type, the Search feature will save CME and Spread as the context for your search, and filter your instrument search results.</p>

               <p><b>Note</b>: Intercommodity spread products are listed in the TT platform with a pipe character "|"  between product names. For example, the soybean crush on CME is listed as ZM|ZL|ZS.
