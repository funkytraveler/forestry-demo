        <ul>
            <li><b>CXL S</b> &mdash; Cancels all working Sell orders for the selected instrument.</li>
            <li><b>CXL All</b> &mdash; Cancels all working orders for the selected instrument.</li>
            <li><b>CXL B</b> &mdash; Cancels all working Buy orders for the selected instrument.</li>

            will be canceled.</p>
            <!-- <p class="">Users
                often submit multiple orders at the same price level. When this
                occurs, MD Trader shows the total number of your orders at that
            price level.</p>
            <p class="">You can access and change each separate order
                by pressing the arrow (&gt;) button located next to the order in the ladder. This opens a side-drawer which
                shows the different orders. You can then select an individual order
            or ctrl-click and select multiple orders. </p>
            <p class="">Once selected,
                you can perform a cancel/replace by moving any order to a different
            price level.</p> --></li>
        </ol>
