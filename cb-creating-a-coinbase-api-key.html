<p>After your Coinbase account is created at coinbase.com, sign in and create a Coinbase API key, API secret, and passphrase. These credentials are required in order to connect to Coinbase via the TT platform.</p>

<p>Multiple API keys and secrets can be created for a single Coinbase account.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: In order to test your algos or trade in the Coinbase test environment, you need to create a separate Coinbase account on public.sandbox.pro.coinbase.com for an individual account, or https://public.sandbox.prime.coinbase.com/ for an institutional account. After creating this account, log in to create an API key, API secret, and passphrase specifically for this environment.</p>

<p>To create a Coinbase API key:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Log in to <a href="https://pro.coinbase.com/">pro.coinbase.com</a> if you are a TT Crypto user, or <a href="https://prime.coinbase.com/">prime.coinbase.com</a> if you are a trading firm user.</p>

		<p><b>Note</b>: If you are creating an API key for the Coinbase "test" environment as a TT Crypto user, 
			log in to <a href="https://public.sandbox.pro.coinbase.com/">public.sandbox.pro.coinbase.com/</a>. If you are a trading firm (instituional) user, log in to <a href="https://public.sandbox.prime.coinbase.com/">https://public.sandbox.prime.coinbase.com/</a> to create an API key for the test (Simulation) environment.</p>

	</li>

<li><p>To create an API key, hover on the list icon on the right corner of the Exchange screen and select 
	<strong>API</strong>.

</p>

<p>Then click <b>Create API Key</b> to create and display the passphrase, new API key, and API secret. Copy or store these values on your computer or device.<p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is the only time your API secret will display.</p>

</li>

<li>Repeat this step to create additional API keys and secrets for the same Coinbase account if needed.</li>

<p><b>Note</b>: If you are a member of a trading firm who does not have administrator permissions in the Setup application on TT, then provide your risk administrator with your API key, secret, and passphrase. If you trade for yourself on TT and have administrator permissions in Setup, you can log in to the Setup application and <a href="http://library.tradingtechnologies.com/user-setup/gdx-reference.html#trader-id">create your trader ID</a> for connecting to TT using your API key, secret, and passphrase.</p>

</li>

</ol>
