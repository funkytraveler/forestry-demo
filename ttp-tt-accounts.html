<h3>Subscriptions</h3>

<p>Use this page to change your TT plan selection and to add or remove markets that you want to trade.</p>

<p>To receive live market data in the Simulation environment, select each of the available markets in the <b>Market Data</b> section of the <b>Subscriptions</b> page. Otherwise, if you don't select a specific market, you'll have access to market data in the delayed environment.</p>

<p>If you meet CME or CFE non-professional requirements, you'll need to sign an agreement with those 
  exchanges. You'll be able to receive live data, but will be billed professional rates until the exchange approves your status as a non-professional.</p>

<h3>Agreements</h3>

<p>This page allows you to review and print market data agreements and other agreements that may be required by an exchange, such as CME or CFE non-professional status agreements. This page also includes the market data agreements you reviewed and accepted during the sign up process.</p>
