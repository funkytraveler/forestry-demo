<p>The Gator Oscillator indicator provides a different view of the <a href="chrt-ti-alligator.html">Alligator</a> indicator. It is a histogram that plots the absolute distance between the red and green averages. Expanding green bars mean the averages are widening and the trend is stronger. Contracting red bars mean the averages are narrowing and the trend is slowing or stopping.</p>

<p>The longer the period of sleep the better the wake-up signal becomes. The trade is held until the middle red line is crossed again.The Gator Oscillator presents the data in a different format to help with interpretation. It is a histogram that plots the absolute distance between the red and green averages. Expanding green bars mean the averages are widening and the trend is stronger. Contracting red bars mean the averages are narrowing and the trend is slowing or stopping.</p>

<p>If the three lines are entwined, then the alligatorâ€™s mouth is closed and he is said to be sleeping.  The Gator Oscillator alternates between green and red bars. Supposedly, during sleep the alligator gets hungry, waiting for a breakout from his sleep so he will eat.  When the trend begins, the Alligator wakes and starts eating.  The Gator Oscillator shows large green bars. Once full, the alligator closes his mouth once again and goes to sleep. Red bars appear on the Gator Oscillator.</p>
