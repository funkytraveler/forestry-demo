<p>You can lock a workspace to prevent any actions in the workspace, such as submitting an order by accidentally clicking the mouse.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Lock all</strong>: Prevents any activity, including moving widgets, within the workspace while locked.</li>
  <li><strong>Lock order entry only</strong>: Prevents order entry but allows all other actions, such as opening or rearranging widgets.</li>
