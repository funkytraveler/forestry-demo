<p class="BodyOther">The %R indicator was developed by Larry Williams
  and introduced in his 1979 book How I Made $1,000,000 Trading Commodities
  Last Year. Williams %R is similar to a stochastic oscillator, as
  it normalizes the price as a percentage between 0 and 100. It is basically
an inverted version of the 'Raw %K' value of a Fast Stochastic.</p>

<p>Selecting the Williams %R indicator allows you to set the <b>Period</b> (as number of minutes) and the color of the result.</p>
