<p>Autospreader allows users to designate one or more legs of a spread solely as pricing components. This enables a user to configure and trade a spread with an instrument that is neither quoted nor hedged and doesn't require position limits. For example, you can configure a spread with Mar17 contracts for ICE Futures U.S. Cocoa (CC) and London Cocoa (C) as the spread legs, and British Pound Futures (6B) as a component in calculating the spread price.</p>

<p>To configure legs as price components:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Click <b>Create</b> in the opened Autospreader widget and configure the synthetic <a href="as-creating-a-synthetic-spread.html">spread definition</a> parameters.</p></li>

	<li><p>Select contracts for each leg of the spread.</p></li>

	<Li><p>Uncheck <b>Active Quoting</b> for the leg used as a pricing component.</p> <p>The <b>Enable Hedging</b> options are displayed and flash yellow for all legs.</p>

	</li>
	<li><p>Uncheck <b>Enable Hedging</b> for the same leg.</p>

		 <p>When the spread in this example is launched and traded, the 6B Mar17 leg is neither quoted nor hedged, but Autospreader includes the instrument when calculating the spread price.</p>

	
	</li>
	<li><p>Preview the spread price, adjust the ticking if needed, and click <b>Save</b>.</p>
