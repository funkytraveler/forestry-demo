<p>TT gives users various ways to view options positions and assess the risk of an options portfolio. In this video we will use the Options Risk widget to demonstrate how to view the Greeks and risk metrics of our open positions, we will simulate changes by applying an adjustment to the underlying instrument price and volatility and we will use the Options Risk Matrix to view our P&L and Greeks across multiple scenarios.<p>
